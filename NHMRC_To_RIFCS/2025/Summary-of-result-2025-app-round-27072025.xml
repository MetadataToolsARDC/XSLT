        <Plain_Description>In collaboration between Australian and Japanese cancer researchers, clinicians and data scientists, we will build a comprehensive pan-cancer spatial map of cancer cells and their immune system from ~2000 patients representing top 10 cancers in our countries. This map will help in understanding why current therapies work only in some patients and some subtypes of cancers. This map will also allow us to identify new drug targets to develop novel therapies and rationalise treatment selection.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Heart attacks damage heart muscle cells and can lead to heart failure with a poor 5-year survival rate. This research will elucidate the mechanisms of this poor heart repair and develop promising therapeutics to stimulate the regrowth of heart muscle. The project will identify the best drug candidate and formulate it so that it can be easily delivered to heart attack patients. The overall goal of this research is to remove roadblocks that prevent the body from healing itself after an injury.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Australia’s hospitals are in crisis, because high rates of preventable adverse events (e.g infections, falls, medication errors), that cause patient harm, remain static. This codesigned HIRAID-Inpatient project will address this problem through the development of a new fit-for-purpose, “whole-of-patient" nursing assessment framework for any patient with any condition on any ward. It will support nurses to deliver consistent high quality and safe care, reduce patient deterioration and save lives.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Australia is in a mental health crisis. Each year, over 3000 people die by suicide, and half of these people had attend an emergency department (ED) in the year before death, but services failed to prevent suicide.  We urgently need to understand what happens to people after they come to hospital so we can improve their MH outcomes. Working with key mental health agencies, results from this study will inform targeted, evidence based strategies to improve MH outcomes. </Plain_Description>

Together, 10 hospitals from across Australia will work together with researchers and policy makers to put in to practice a new medical device that will reduce pain, and improve our ability to give therapies, such as antibiotics and hydration. We will then put together a tool-kit to allow other hospitals across Australia to do the same. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>IVF ‘add-ons’ are optional extras which can be added to standard IVF protocols. Most IVF add-ons are not proven to be beneficial or safe, but patients may not realise this as information on the internet is unreliable and exaggerates potential benefits. We will develop a new website that has accurate information about add-ons, based on scientific evidence, and is trusted by IVF patients and doctors. IVF patients and doctors will help us to design it and experts will review the evidence.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>This project will use cutting-edge technologies to discover safe and effective new ‘clot busting’ therapies for stroke. Strokes are caused by blockages in blood flow to the brain, starving the tissues of oxygen and nutrients. One Australian suffers a stroke about every 19 mins, but the only therapy available does not work for many patients. Our novel anticoagulants are expected to dissolve clots without risky bleeding to save lives, prevent disability and reduce the enormous burden of stroke.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Epilepsy is a common neurological disease with many different types. Certain types of epilepsy are known to have a genetic basis; however, large gaps remain in our understanding. This project aims to fill in the gaps by studying patients and families with epilepsy to discover new epilepsy genes and risk factors. Knowing the genes and biological pathways involved in disease manifestation will inform future research, provide new therapeutic avenues, and lead to better patient outcomes. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Human-induced climate change (HICC) has already caused many problems including increasing health burden caused by bushfire smoke. This project will: 1) quantify global and country-specific bushfire smoke exposure caused by HICC and the related health burden during 2000-2025; 2) determine biomarkers and biological mechanisms that can detect and explain the health impacts of bushfire smoke. The outputs will inform targeted and effective preventions and interventions and promote climate actions.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The epigenome is the master regulator of cell fate and function, and subject to spectacular failure in disease. With frontier methodologies to capture epigenomes at unprecedented resolution, this project will focus on the aging brain to determine how brain cell-specific epigenetic changes drive neurological disease states in males and females, and importantly, how to reverse them. This work bridges the gap between technology and fundamental knowledge with the goal to improve future therapies.       </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>1 in 10 people admitted to hospital develop an infection as a complication of their healthcare. These infections lead to significant patient suffering and unnecessary deaths. Current methods for infection prevention and control are complex, inefficient and costly. In partnership with Queensland Health services and patients, I will develop state-of-the-art systems and knowledge translation solutions that inform infection control programs and combat rising infection-associated death rates.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>To answer health research questions researchers traditionally bring together results from studies published in journals. But often, not all required information is available in these articles. New methods bring together full datasets of previous studies. My research program will advance these methods, looking at how to find and exclude fraudulent or low-quality studies and reduce bias or ‘spin’ in interpretation. I will apply these methods to answer crucial questions on care of premature babies.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Epilepsy is a major health issue, affecting over 250,000 Australians of all ages. Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcomes, but many Australians experiencing first seizures do not receive care that meets international standards. Additionally, half of those with epilepsy do not take their antiseizure medication as prescribed. My research program will use national healthcare data and interviews with people with epilepsy to find the best ways to improve epilepsy care and close knowledge gaps.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Kidney transplantation is a life saving treatment for many patients with kidney failure. However, it is not available to all patients who need one due to limited organ availability. Once transplanted, there are also many challenges including increased cancer and infection risks, and early graft loss from rejection. This program of work will implement novel interventions and strategies to drive sustainable improvements in health outcomes and overall well-being of kidney transplant patients.  </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Vision depends not only on the eyes, but also on many brain areas. Without the latter the visual information cannot be decoded, and the person becomes blind even if the eyes are spared. For example, when an area named the primary visual cortex (V1) is damaged by stroke or trauma, a type of profound blindness ensues, for which there is no treatment. I will explore how visual information can be channeled to non-damaged parts of the brain, in search of ways to restore vision following V1 damage.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description> Worldwide, Australia has the highest frequency of the autoimmune disease scleroderma, which affects people in the prime of life. Scleroderma can involve many organs within the body, particularly the heart and the lungs, and is associated with impaired physical function and markedly reduced life expectancy. This program of research aims to improve the outlook for those affected, through finding ways to determine who is at risk of poor outcomes and tailoring management to the individual.  </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>RNA is the ‘voice’ of our DNA, allowing fine-tuning of our genetic code. Changes in our DNA that alter RNA splicing can cause disease; however, RNA splicing variants are hard for clinicians to interpret. My research vision is to build tools to interpret RNA splicing variants. These tools will help diagnose more individuals with rare genetic disorders, providing families access to support groups, informed treatment options, knowledge of disease progression, and genetic therapies.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Organ transplants are life-saving but require long-term medications to block the immune system to prevent rejection. This means transplant recipients suffer enormously from serious, complex infections. My research program aims to improve the lives of transplant patients by using new tests of immune function to optimize the dosing of immunosuppressive medications, predicting and anticipating those at high risk and intervening before infections occur. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical skin infection caused by a bacterium. Through research led by my team over the past 20 years we now know the infection in Australia is spread by mosquitoes. In this project we will track the pathogen in the environment and eliminate Buruli ulcer by curing the infection in Australian native possums and by innovative mosquito control measures. We will also explore vaccines to prevent Buruli ulcer in humans.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>In normal biology, genes can be switched on or off so that the same set of genes can result in many different cell types. If we can harness the power to switch genes on or off therapeutically then we could treat myriad incurable diseases. Here we will apply a new strategy to switch genes on and off. We will develop novel potential treatments for the neurodevelopmental disorder Prader Willi Syndrome and investigate in which other diseases our approach is suitable.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Our immune systems protect us remarkably well from a constant barrage of germs. However, this protection must be finely balanced to not overreact (as in asthma) or leave us vulnerable to infection (as in immune deficiency). My research program aims to understand how DNA is read differently in different cells, termed 'epigenetics', despite all cells of the body having the same DNA code, with the ultimate goal to develop new epigenetic-targeting drugs to restore healthy immunity in disease.</Plain_Description>

My research has shown the immense potential of blood-biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostics. However, there are still gaps to address. Here, I will focus on developing novel biomarkers for non-AD dementias, assess how other health factors affect both AD and non-AD dementia biomarkers, and test how well these biomarkers work in clinics.</Plain_Description>

These patients also have the worst prognosis. My research will explore the differences in ovarian cancer cells with WGD, assess changes linked with WGD even before the cancer is diagnosed,  and look for therapeutic targets to treat cancers with WGD.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The global effort toward malaria elimination requires an array of tools to prevent, treat and block transmission of the malaria parasite. Blocking transmission involves targeting proteins that are essential for malaria parasite fertilisation in mosquitos, thereby preventing mosquito to human transmission. Understanding how these proteins work and discovering new fertilisation proteins is essential for developing effective interventions, like antibody treatments, to prevent transmission.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Schizophrenia is a complex and severe brain disorder that can affect how someone thinks, feels, and behaves. The biological cause of schizophrenia likely differs from patient to patient, making it hard to develop optimal treatments that benefit all patients. This project is designed to develop personalised insights into schizophrenia by harnessing the power of stem cell science, genetics and neuroimaging. These insights could lead to improved diagnosis and tailored treatments for schizophrenia.</Plain_Description>

The proposed research will compare different diagnostic systems to determine which ones work best for different purposes, and will develop tools for using them in practice.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) predominantly affects young women. SLE causes organ damage, poor quality of life, and early death. Many factors contribute to serial unsuccessful clinical trials and thus a lack of novel therapies, such that patients are still mostly treated with drugs from the 1950s.  My research will address key issues in lupus, including measurement tools, biological insights, and developing both broad and specific novel therapies. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Amyloid clearing drugs for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are a step forward, but their benefits are limited, and we still need to understand much more about this incurable disorder. My program has studied the changes in brain iron in AD and recently linked these to energy failure. My program will illuminate the mechanisms involved, to identify new drug targets, imaging and blood tests, and test new drug candidates.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication with high blood pressure and organ damage, affecting >6 million women annually. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) women at risk of pre-eclampsia are not identified. This means they do not receive aspirin which can prevent it. My research will determine how risk screening and preventing pre-eclampsia in LMICs can be improved. I will find out which dose of aspirin is best for women and babies and what new drugs can prevent pre-eclampsia.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are critical for tissue replacement therapy, studying diseases, and trialling drugs. However, generating these cells and 'reprogramming' them, is expensive and time consuming, and produces cells of mixed quality. Making these cells requires the delivery of genes, which is not well understood. This research will develop new tools using 'DNA origami' to understand and improve how genes are delivered into cells, for safe and efficient generation of iPSCs.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphaviruses threaten ~4 billion people and cause ~5 million disability-adjusted life years lost annually. Treatment options for flaviviruses and alphaviruses are limited by a poor understanding of the mechanisms underpinning infection and disease. This research program will identify key mechanisms of JEV and CHIKV infection and disease, leading to new antiviral and anti-inflammatory strategies. The research program will also expedite development of new vaccines.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Women and their babies are healthier when pregnancies are spaced at least 18 months apart. However, lack of information and access to postpartum contraception means many women unintentionally fall pregnant again soon after birth. Midwives are well-placed to provide contraception information and care, yet this is not common practice in Australia. My research aims to develop, implement and evaluate a midwifery model of care to increase access to postpartum contraception.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Regulation of different signals and processes is key to cellular health. A major way cells achieve this is attaching the small protein ‘ubiquitin’ to specific targets. This acts as a code, read by other proteins and results in changes to cell function. Recently, new players in this code have been identified but we have limited ways to ‘see’ them in cells. Our research will discover and understand the role of these new players in ubiquitin signalling during infection, cell death and inflammation.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Recently, it was discovered that mutations in stem cells, termed CHIP, accelerate heart disease. Distressingly, there are no formal guidelines for clinicians in the management of CHIP as this is a new disease. This project aims to halt CHIP development, and prevent heart disease in this population. Our findings will have implications on how people with CHIP are managed in the clinic. Furthermore, we propose that these patients will benefit from an existing and safe diabetic therapeutic.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a hidden cause of high blood pressure that can lead to stroke, irregular heartbeat, and heart attack. It is caused by the adrenal glands producing too much aldosterone and is potentially curable. My goal is to identify over half a million patients with high blood pressure due to undiagnosed PA. We aim to revamp guidelines and develop better tests to ensure that every affected individual has the best chance for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Memory T cells confer protection against infections and cancers, but to do so, they must be optimally localised and be armed with appropriate functionality. Generating memory T cells with optimal function and localisation is the ultimate goal of any vaccination and cancer therapy, yet we do not fully understand the mechanisms underlying their development. This study will investigate the factors driving development of immune cells in tissues, a critical step for advancing T cell-based medicines.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Nearly 3% of children globally have intellectual disability. They have poorer health, functioning and quality of life than typically developing children. Their families want care to focus on better everyday health, functioning and quality of life, yet few evidence-based interventions are available. I will identify needed interventions and develop valid, reliable and sensitive ways of assessing their effectiveness. My research is discovering which treatments best improve these needed outcomes.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>During metastasis, cancer cells spread from the primary tumour and form metastases at distant sites through dampening the body's anti-cancer immune response. I previously discovered that a unique immune molecule, interferon epsilon (IFNe), prevents metastasis of ovarian cancer. This project will investigate the mechanism of IFNe in ovarian cancer &amp; its effects in other cancers (pancreatic, gastric &amp; colorectal). It will also support the clinical development of IFNe as a new cancer immunotherapy.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The ability of the heart to pump blood effectively is dependent on a robust electrical communication system. Mutations in the genes that control electrical activity of the heart increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. The development of tests to accurately predict which mutations are high risk will enable implementation of therapy to reduce risk. The tools we develop will also enable us to screen for new drugs to treat patients at risk of cardiac arrhythmias.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Drug-resistant enteric bacteria represent a major global public health challenge. In this project I will provide critical insights on how these bacteria adapt and evolve for increased drug-resistance and/or pathogenicity, and develop novel approaches suitable for large scale datasets. This will facilitate enhanced public health surveillance through improved detection and prevention of outbreaks of these drug-resistant bacteria.  </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Today, Indigenous Australians are still impacted by historical and social factors, and traumas. These may cause Indigenous Australians to turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism or to not access treatment services, as they may feel service providers may not be sensitive or understanding of them. The knowledge gained in this project will help reduce stigma associated with Indigenous Australians and alcohol, and inform the development of culturally-informed treatment and policy options.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Thrombosis, causing heart attacks and strokes, affects millions of lives. An imaging chip that can visualise blood clotting will facilitate our knowledge and guide safer drug development. Building on my novel imaging profiling platform, I aim to integrate a molecular fingerprint database and translate it into a low-cost, portable, standardised point-of-care imaging chip to monitor blood clotting and test new drugs. It will be game-changing for our ability to diagnose and monitor thrombosis.  </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Brain tumours are one of the most severe types of cancer, with ~2000 Australians diagnosed every year. High-grade gliomas are aggressive forms of brain cancer with extremely poor prognoses. While cancer researchers have identified proteins that are 'druggable' targets for glioma therapy, traditional methods for designing drugs against these targets have proven ineffective. I will establish a new design method - PaFO - to develop much needed drug candidates for treating this devastating disease.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Too many Australians struggle to breathe due to chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and many even die. In COPD, the lungs are gradually damaged but early progression is currently hard to detect. In fact, by the time someone is diagnosed with COPD they are on a deadly slippery slope. My program will find ways to identify early lung damage (so called pre-COPD) and new interventions (eg drugs, exercise) to stop pre-COPD, a globally health priority.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>DNA repair is vital for maintaining cell health and preventing cancer. When DNA is damaged, the cell needs to repair it accurately to prevent harmful consequences. Fanconi anaemia (FA) proteins, together with BRCA1, are crucial components of this repair process. They help signal and coordinate the repair efforts, ensuring that the damage is repaired. My proposal aims to understand how these proteins facilitate DNA repair, to identify new targets to combat rare genetic disorders and cancer.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Since 2000, more than 11 million lives have been saved in Africa by using tests, treatments, and mosquito control to fight malaria. But progress has stalled, and our gains are threatened by the evolution of resistance to these interventions, and by a new invasive mosquito that could bring malaria into Africa's cities. My research program will deliver new approaches to map and forecast these threats so we can better target new interventions and get malaria control back on track.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Kidney failure is common, harmful and treatable, yet treatment is costly, difficult to access and often varies in quality. This grant will support my ongoing world-leading research program on transforming home-based dialysis to make it cheaper, less burdensome, safer and more effective by standardising quality indicators, conducting real-world, patient-centric trials, implementing these findings globally, and confirming better patient outcomes with the program’s global monitoring structures.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is caused by the degeneration of cartilage, a tissue essential for normal joint function. The damage is not repaired naturally, and clinical strategies to generate healthy cartilage have failed. To address this vital gap in the treatment of OA, this project focuses on the key challenge of oxygen regulation in engineered tissues. It will create biomaterials with novel oxygen delivery capabilities, which will enable successful cartilage repair.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Heart rhythm problems such as atrial fibrillation (AF) (an irregular heart rhythm, or frequent 'extra beats' can be the cause of a weakened heart muscle. Eliminating the abnormal rhythm can restore heart function often completely, however the usual medications used in a weakened heart are currently continued indefinitely. Similarly, when treated early, such usual medications may not be needed at all. This study explores this type of weakened heart treatment through several clinical trials.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Blocking adrenomedullin (AM) signaling has emerged as a promising strategy to suppress solid tumor growth and prevent their spread. However, AM acts through two receptors, AM1R and AM2R, which differently affect tumor development and cardiovascular function. My research focuses on developing molecules that can distinguish between these two AM receptors, advancing our understanding of AM physiology and offering insights for developing cancer treatments.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer with poor clinical outcomes. Currently there are no specific blood biomarkers/tools for TNBC diagnosis,  prognosis and monitoring. Circulating small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) offer exciting prospects as cancer biomarkers, however, their application in clinic has been limited. This program aims to develop a novel nanotechnology platform to translate sEVs as cancer biomarkers for personalized TNBC management.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Gynaecological cancers are the fourth most common cancer type in Australian women but current treatment guiding surgical practice lacks quality evidence for patient benefit. My work will address this gap through my leadership of 4 international clinical trials. My aim is to improve surgical outcomes in gynaecological cancer through evidence-based, personalised  and patient-centred care. My decision-making tools are expected to lead to fewer complications and better quality of life for patients.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Inequalities in health remain stark within high income countries such as Australia. To reverse this trajectory, greater involvement in health and medical research from those who experience these inequalities is required. In this Investigator Grant I will focus on a neglected aspect of diversity within health and medical research activity – the research workforce itself. The outcomes will improve equity, within the health and medical research workforce and, over time, in health outcomes.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Cancer cells can change their behaviour in response to therapy, a process called "cellular plasticity." This adaptability results in metastatic disease and treatment resistance. Targeting these plastic cells could be a new way to treat cancer. My aim is to understand how “plasticity” occurs by using advanced molecular techniques to discover new pathways and targets associated with these particular cancer cells. The end goal of my research is to improve outcomes for breast cancer patients.</Plain_Description>

In many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease and ALS, axon loss is an early event contributing to dysfunction of the nervous system. My research will provide mechanistic insight into the axon degeneration program and deliver new strategies for developing neuroprotective therapies.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description> Our bodies use programmed cell death to kill cells that are dangerous or superfluous. The pathways that control cell death are exciting targets for drug discovery, for example to kill cells that cause cancer, or to keep cells alive in heart attack or stroke. Our studies of the molecular components of the cell death machinery will reveal new strategies for developing novel therapeutics to manipulate dysfunctional cell death in disease settings.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The microbiome, a group of microorganisms in our bodies, helps train immune cells and influences how we fight cancer. This research uses a mouse model that mirrors human exposure to microbes to study how the microbiome affects tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), an immune population that protects organs like the gut from infections and cancer, with the goal of finding new ways to boost the immune system and improve cancer treatment.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Eliminating HIV transmission is possible with effective methods like treatment as prevention (TasP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, disparities remain, with new infections decreasing among Australian-born men who have sex with men, but not among overseas-born men. My research uses community input to create and evaluate HIV prevention solutions, helping to shape policy and ensure no one is left behind as Australia aims to be the first in the world to eliminate HIV transmission.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Babies are vulnerable to infections, particularly with multidrug-resistant bacteria that have emerged with increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide. We will conduct an international multicentre study across Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia &amp; the Philippines to identify how, and when, babies become colonised &amp; infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. We will find ways to interrupt this transmission, and provide world-first data to understand the impact antibiotics have on the infant microbiome.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Breast cancers with ERα protein (~80% of breast cancers) are treated with therapies that inhibit cancer growth but do not kill them. Thus, these cells persist and can cause recurrence or incurable metastasis. I aim to characterize these persistent cancer cells and explore strategies for their elimination to prevent recurrence/spread. If successful, I will identify a strategy that can be integrated into standard-of-care therapies to permanently eradicate these persistent cells and achieve a cure.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Breast cancer (BC) screening reduces risk of BC death. There is uncertainty about how BC screening programs could be improved to increase benefit. This research plan will fill key knowledge gaps to inform changes to BC screening by investigating new technologies (tomosynthesis, AI), assessing impact on women of being informed they have dense breasts, and examining risk-adapted screening. Findings will prepare BC screening programs including BreastScreen for future practice to improve outcomes.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Heart failure is a major cause of disability, frequent hospital admissions and fatalities. Prevention is feasible but needs to be guided by the recognition of risk and detection of early-stage disease. This proposal seeks to develop efficient screening using Artificial Intelligence approaches to provide the cornerstone diagnostic techniques – advanced electrocardiography and echocardiography - to the hands of non-cardiologists who care for at-risk patients, especially in rural and remote areas. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, previously called 'fatty liver' disease) affects 1 in 3 adults and can lead to heart and advanced liver disease. Exercise is beneficial but not regularly undertaken by most people with MASLD. My research program will establish: an exercise care pathway to support people with MASLD; the benefit of exercise on important features of severe liver disease; and sustainable exercise options that maintain health benefits long-term.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The number of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (First Nations) peoples is growing, and home-based aged care services may not meet their needs because they focus on problems and not a person’s strengths. First Nations researchers and Elders have shown we must work with people’s strengths to solve health and ageing challenges. This project will show how older First Nations people’s strengths can be built on to ensure that aged care services meet their needs and support healthy ageing.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Leukaemia is the most common cancer in children and, despite high cure rates, is a leading cause of childhood mortality in Australia. The disease is caused by mutations in DNA, however the factors that influence when and where within the genome these mutations occur are poorly understood. In this project, I aim to reveal how the genome is organized in three dimensions and explore how disorganization of this intricate DNA network may influence DNA mutations and thus the development of leukaemia.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Muscle strengthening activity (MSA) positively impacts physical and psychological health, yet youth participation is limited. Sport offers a unique setting to target youth activity behaviour, as well as influence knowledge and understanding of MSA. However, few sports provide evidence-based MSA information to end-users. My program of research aims to support healthy communities through the generation of new evidence to inform MSA knowledge, skills and competency within grassroots sport. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Disruptive menstrual symptoms, such as heavy menstrual bleeding and severe menstrual pain, are common conditions that place a heavy social, physical, and mental toll on many Australians. Lack of knowledge on menstrual and gynaecological conditions and their consequences is a barrier in current healthcare. My research will reveal the evidence needed to improve health policy and guidelines for better diagnosis and management of these conditions and improve health and wellbeing across life.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>In response to increasingly toxic drug markets, Australian jurisdictions have initiated drug checking services which analyse illicit drugs and give results back to consumers within a health intervention. Through mixed-methods participatory research, I will address knowledge gaps regarding longer term health outcomes, leveraging community experiences and reaching diverse groups. This work will prevent drug overdoses, reducing morbidity, mortality, and economic costs to our healthcare system.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The most recent pandemic, COVID-19, highlighted how under prepared we are against emerging and reemerging viruses. The control of such viruses demands both novel drug discovery and vaccine development programs.  This investigator award tackles clinically-significant viruses that have major health burden, in the context of morbidity, mortality and economic impact. The major outcome of this award will be the delivery of novel antiviral drug candidates that will reduce this health burden.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>In Australia, 1:2 women who enter pregnancy live with overweight or obesity. To reduce pregnancy and birth complications current care has focused on dietary changes to limit the amount of weight gained during pregnancy. Direct evidence from my research program has shown this approach is ineffective.   A better approach is to improve women’s health before pregnancy. I will generate reliable, evidence-based information to change care and improve health outcomes for all women and their babies.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>This research program will develop and test new ways to repair damaged pancreas and heart by harnessing the restorative capabilities of the key elastic protein tropoelastin. By restoring elasticity, we expect to significantly improve organ function after disease. We will also spatially map elastin’s distribution in the normal and diseased lung. This research will pave the way for new treatments to improve outcomes from common conditions such as cancer, heart attack, and damaged lung.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description> Imagine our cells as bustling cities, like any city waste is produce and needs to be effectively removed. When this fails, cell death can occur. Retromer is central to the process of waste removal and is often destabilised in neurodegenerative disease. Using machine learning techniques, I will design a suite of molecules that stabilise Retromer. If successful, this could lead to novel therapies for Parkinson’s disease as well as Alzheimer’s and related dementias. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Healthcare produces 7% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The Australian Government has committed to net-zero healthcare by 2050. This needs to come from reducing emissions of clinical care, with a first step being reducing low value care.   This research will 1) quantify emissions of 3 common surgeries and procedures that are potentially low value, 2) quantify emissions of low value treatments for lower back pain, and 3) develop a carbon database of medical devices and interventions.  </Plain_Description>

This project focuses on a specific family of brain receptor proteins that are well-validated in the control of cognition. I will leverage groundbreaking discoveries that I have made of novel binding sites on these proteins to overcome current medicinal limitations to yield more targeted, safer and efficacious medicines to treat SCZ and AD.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>It is well known that poor sleep worsens mental health. Despite this knowledge, mental healthcare clinicians receive almost no training in treating sleep problems. This project will launch an Australia-wide online training initiative to upskill mental healthcare clinicians to deliver effective sleep treatments. This project will ensure clinicians have the knowledge and skills needed to treat sleep problems and improve sleep and mood outcomes in individuals experiencing mental health disorders.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The production of antibodies is critical to health, protecting us from infectious agents and their toxic products. In some cases protection lasts for months, in others for a lifetime, and new protective specificities are able to be added without overwhelming the system. The aim of this research project is to understand how the survival of the cells that make antibodies is determined and its relationship to age, specificity and the overall immune status.</Plain_Description>

We study how a mother’s beneficial bacteria affect her baby's health, aiming to create new ways to support infants from birth. We also look at how human migration impacts maternal-child health. By employing special models that mimic early gut interactions, we hope to develop better immunity for infants, ensuring they have a healthy start in life.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>As the population ages, there is increasing need to develop therapies to slow or reverse neurodegeneration. This project focuses on decoding the genetic risk factors that predispose individuals to Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. How these DNA variations lead to disease is almost entirely unknown. This project will deliver: 1) mechanistic insight into how gene variants predispose patients to disease; and 2) identify new therapeutic targets to treat Parkinson’s and related diseases.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Preterm brain injury can lead to life-long disability, with limited treatments. I have shown that application of umbilical cord blood cells reduces preterm brain injury, but optimising therapy for human use is difficult because we don’t understand how they work and there is limited availability of cells. Using state-of-the-art preclinical models of preterm brain damage, I will determine how the cells reduce injury, allowing me to develop optimal cell therapies to treat preterm brain injury.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>My research will focus on infants born very preterm (less than 32 weeks of gestation) and at term (greater than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation) who suffer brain injuries in the perinatal period. I will create tools from brain scans that can be used to discover the precise causes and consequences of perinatal brain injuries in these infants. This could help to improve the clinical management and health and development of these infants over their lifetimes.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Coronary heart disease (CHD) occurs due to fatty plaque build-up in the coronary arteries, and the risk of heart attack or death increases in proportion to the amount of plaque. CT scans are a low-radiation test routinely used to assess for CHD. I aim to apply a rapid and accurate artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solution for measuring the total amount of coronary plaque on CT scans in a randomised clinical trial, where it will guide personalised testing and treatment of patients with CHD.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Programmed cell death is essential for maintaining healthy biological processes. However, when dysregulated it can contribute to disease. My program of research focusses on RIPK3 and MLKL, the final effector proteins of a highly inflammatory form of cell death called necroptosis. I will characterise the structural transitions that these proteins undergo during the execution of cell death, rendering them highly attractive targets for development of new therapies to treat inflammatory diseases.  </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Hundreds of thousands of Australians are now using prescribed medical cannabis, most often for chronic pain which is notoriously difficult to treat. Though medical cannabis is a promising treatment alternative, we lack essential information about its efficacy and safety due to a lack of research. This project aims to address this knowledge gap through a series of multidisciplinary patient-focused investigations. The results will have direct implications for health and road safety policy.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Where malaria transmission is extremely high in Africa and India, virtually everyone is infected with diverse parasite species and strains. Most people do not have symptoms so they will not come to the clinic to be diagnosed. To eliminate malaria, we have to be proactive and find these infected people with no symptoms by using sensitive molecular diagnostics. This project will use such diagnostics to define better strategies to eliminate malaria where transmission is high.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Many cancer targets exist inside cells, and despite the development of effective antibodies against them, they remain undruggable due to the delivery challenges. By developing mRNA-encoded antibodies, I will leverage our lipid nanoparticle technology to deliver therapeutic antibodies inside cancer cells, creating drugs for previously undruggable targets. This will expand the applicability of antibodies beyond surface targets and enable modulation of internal targets within cancer cells.</Plain_Description>

Despite this, heart disease in women remains under-recognised, under-treated and under-researched. This research program will tackle inequities in care for women by improving prevention and early diagnosis of coronary heart disease as well as better understanding and treatment of female-dominant types of heart attacks. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>For many children in Australian hospitals, admission to hospital could be prevented or treatment could have been given at home. Unnecessary hospitalisations reduce children's quality of life and delay care for others. Children are commonly hospitalised due to infections requiring intravenous antibiotics. My research focuses on changing how we use intravenous antibiotics so that more children can be at home. By developing national guidelines, I will ensure children benefit from my findings.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Drug discovery research is plagued by high failure rates. Targeting allosteric sites on proteins offers a new approach to drug discovery. However, allosteric sites are more difficult to investigate because they can be located anywhere on a protein. This project aims to explore how different types of drug-like molecules interact with cell proteins to regulate their function. The outcomes of this research will inform future academic and industrial drug discovery programs.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Specialised immune cells, called T cells, recognise and kill virus infected and tumour cells. Sometimes T cells fail, resulting in chronic infection and cancer. Proteins are the building blocks that determine a cell’s function. This proposal uses new cutting-edge technology to measure the thousands of proteins that make up a T cell. By comparing how proteins differ between successful and failed responses we will identify and test new ways to improve T cell defence against cancer and infection.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>New technologies make it possible to measure important features of cells, like the activity of genes, from slices of tissue. The potential for these technologies is enormous, but we need new computational tools to take full advantage. Here, we propose to develop new statistical and AI methods to address key data analysis challenges in the field and work with national and international colleagues to link genetics to the behaviour of cells in tissues in diseases like pulmonary fibrosis. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Telomeres are specialised structures at the ends of human chromosomes that function to regulate cellular proliferation. Loss of telomere integrity promotes aging, while telomere maintenance is a pre-requisite for cancer cell immortality. The project aims to elucidate the DNA damage and repair mechanisms that exist at telomeres in normal cells, during cellular aging, and in immortal cancer cells. The overarching aim is to improve health outcomes for cancer and age-associated diseases.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Proteins are the backbone of the biological world. As we age, some proteins misfold and accumulate in the brain causing devastating diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease. The fine details of how and why this happens are unknown. I plan to develop molecules that will allow us to 1) detect the identity and 2) see the molecular-level details of the misfolded proteins to unravel some of these mysteries. This research could lead to better diagnostics and effective treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>1 in 10 people develop arthritis. A major hurdle for effective treatments is distinguishing "Rogue" disease-causing cells from normal cells. To study arthritic joints, I have built a national network collecting clinical samples that are otherwise discarded in hospitals, from >100 arthritis patients. I am applying cutting-edge methods, to identify and deeply interrogate immune cells that go "rogue" to drive flares and joint inflammation. Our knowledge gains will inform future targeted therapies.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Medical devices such as catheters and stents are critical for patient care worldwide, but they often fail due to blood clotting and bacterial infections. This project aims to improve the performance of these devices by developing innovative bioactive coatings that continuously generate nitric oxide, a potent molecule that prevents both blood clotting and infections. The outcome of this research will significantly reduce implant failures, leading to better patient outcomes.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are predicted to kill 10 million people annually by 2050. Bacteriophages (phages, bacteria-eating viruses) are a promising treatment option against these ‘superbugs’. However, phage therapy is in its infancy and its therapeutic potential is severely limited by inefficient phage production and a lack of pharmacological data. My project addresses these major knowledge gaps by developing a clinically adaptable phage therapy platform to treat ‘superbug’ infections.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Cells sense and respond to a variety of stimuli by activating different signaling pathways. The Wnt pathway is important in embryonic development as it controls cell division and specialization. In adults, dysregulation of this pathway can lead to aberrant cell division and cancer. This proposal will use structural biology to look at several steps of this pathway at the molecular level. This will provide answers on how this pathway works and will lead to new ways to target it therapeutically.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description> Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition where there are too many bacteria in the small intestine which can negatively impact many diseases. It is common in people with functional gut disorders (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) causing similar symptoms. Current tests are unreliable, so treatment is often based on trial and error. My research aims to develop better techniques for diagnosing SIBO and create new therapies to modify the gut bacteria to treat or even eradicate SIBO. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The human brain connectome, the complete set of ~100 trillion synaptic connections between ~100 billion neurons, is constantly changing. Some changes are beneficial, allowing us to learn. Others are harmful, resulting in neuropsychiatric disorders. This project examines anxiety and depression as "connectopathies" caused by chronic stress. Using an innovative new method, it will chart how stress changes brain connectivity in animal models, and explain what makes females the more vulnerable sex.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Clinical guidelines rely on trustworthy data. I have revealed that 25% of Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs) in women’s health are untrustworthy. As a world first I developed methods to detect such problematic RCTs. This Fellowship aims to apply these novel methods, applicable to other disciplines, on existing reproductive health literature, and update it with my ongoing RCTs. This will ensure patient care is based on reliable evidence and create better outcomes for women and babies.    </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease with onset usually in childhood or young adulthood that has been treated with insulin for over 100 years. Insulin is not a cure and T1D treatment remains burdensome. The recent development of numerous drugs that affect the immune system means that the treatment of T1D is poised to be transformed. My VISION is to challenge insulin replacement therapy by implementing disease-modifying immunotherapies to improve outcomes for those with T1D.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>1 in 10 people admitted to hospital develop an infection as a complication of their healthcare. These infections lead to significant patient suffering and unnecessary deaths. Current methods for infection prevention and control are complex, inefficient and costly. In partnership with Queensland Health services and patients, we will develop state-of-the-art systems and knowledge translation solutions that inform infection control programs and combat rising infection associated death rates.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Tasmania has the most rapidly ageing population in Australia and some of the poorest health outcomes of any Australian state or territory. The Tasmanian Collaboration for Health Improvement (TCHI) is a partnership between the Tasmanian Department of Health and Tasmanian Health Services, the University of Tasmania, Primary Health Tasmania and Health Consumers Tasmania. Together, five priority projects have been co-developed to address the health needs and regional health challenges in Tasmania.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Infections that develop in patients when they are receiving healthcare are called healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). They occur in about 10% of Australian patients and are responsible for serious illness and sometimes death. Continuous surveillance that measures all HAIs in a hospital is too time-consuming to do continuously, and therefore this study would count all HAIs in several Victorian hospitals at a particular time, providing important information about how best to prevent them. </Plain_Description>

Bereaved families also need ongoing support. This research will transform the way in which paediatric post-sepsis follow-up services are delivered by co-designing, developing and tailoring care plans, primary health clinician guidelines, and prioritising outcomes and reporting. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Medications can sometimes cause serious problems, like ending up in hospital or even death. People living in rural and deprived areas are more vulnerable to these problems. We aim to work with rural consumers and healthcare providers to develop a new computer support tool that will help health professionals find people who might be at risk because of their medicines. Then, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists can check these medications and make necessary changes to keep rural Australians safe. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>When patients present to emergency departments with a suspected heart attack (acute coronary syndrome (ACS)), administering the right interventions quickly is vital. Clinical pathways guide clinicians on what to do and are considered best-practice, however, ACS Pathway use is known to be low. This study aims to understand why this is and what can be done to improve its use to support appropriate and timely healthcare for ACS patients, with a focus on the unique characteristics of rural services.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The acute shortage of radiologists within the Queensland public health system, has produced an urgent need for a refinement to their role, to increase the speed and accuracy of their diagnoses. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist radiologists with their diagnoses of medical images has proven to be viable and highly advantageous. This project trials the first implementation of an AI medical imaging diagnostic system within a Queensland public healthcare service. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rapidly increasing causes of morbidity and death globally. Over 90% of cases of HCC occur as a consequence of cirrhosis of the liver. Retrospective studies show aspirin therapy can reduce the risk of HCC in cirrhosis. We will conduct a randomised clinical trial of aspirin vs placebo therapy in people with cirrhosis in order to determine whether aspirin can prevent HCC. The findings will change practice and result in substantial savings in health care costs.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Alcohol misuse is a leading cause of preventable death in Australia. However, treatment options for alcohol problems have limited efficacy. This will be the first human trial of cannabidiol (CBD) for the management of treatment-resistant alcohol use disorder (CAN-AUD). The CAN-AUD project will evaluate the efficacy and cost-efficacy of CBD to reduce alcohol consumption. The results will generate high level clinical evidence for a safe new treatment for a common life threatening problem.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Current treatment regimens to prevent relapsing malaria are too long. A shorter higher dose treatment could improve treatment outcomes but this needs to be balanced against increased risk of side effects. Recent data from a trial in children in PNG suggests a shortened treatment of 3 days is safe and effective. Our multicentre trial will assess the safety and efficacy of an ultra-short primaquine course. This trial is expected to directly influence global treatment policies.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>One in every 10 children admitted to hospital with an infection receives an aminoglycoside antibiotic. A serious risk of these drugs is permanent hearing loss for which no effective prevention method exists. This study will discover how to prevent hearing loss from aminoglycosides in children by finding out the risk of hearing loss with different treatment doses or lengths, identifying if early hearing damage can be detected using novel blood markers, and testing for genetic risk factors. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Back pain is highly prevalent in Australia and associated with functional and work loss, and decreased quality of life. While many treatments are offered to manage back pain, only few are known to work. RFA is a popular approach that can lead to pain relief by acting directly on the nerve supply from the joints. But we do not know if this treatment works. The RELIEF trial will test if RFA is better than placebo in terms of pain relief, medication use and increase in function.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming more common. It can lead to kidney failure, heart problems, disability, and early death. It is important to find medicines that stop CKD from getting worse without spending too much money, using too many resources or taking too long. This project builds on the recently funded CAPTIVATE platform trial. A second medicine, semaglutide, will be added to this trial to test which combination treatments are best.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Sepsis is a major global public health problem. Corticosteroids, a commonly used drug in clinical practice, has been evaluated in patients with septic shock with inconsistent results. We propose to conduct a blinded, 2 arm randomized clinical trial: a) Hydrocortisone and b) hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone in patients with septic shock to determine if there are any differences on survival and functional recovery in patients with septic shock.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy are complete) is a huge worldwide issue. "Very preterm" infants are those born more than 2 months early and are at the highest risk of complications. Caffeine (yes, as in coffee!) is one of the best medications we have for very preterm babies - it helps with their breathing and has benefits that persist into later childhood. However, we are not sure of the best dose of caffeine for very preterm babies, and the BabyCCINO trial will answer that question.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a brain cancer with poor survival rates and no major treatment advancements in 20 years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have succeeded in other cancers by boosting the immune response. Nivolumab, targeting PD-1, combined with relatlimab, blocking LAG-3, shows promise. The GIANT trial tests this combination in newly diagnosed GBM patients, aiming to improve outcomes by using these drugs before surgery.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Skin cancer is Australia's most common and expensive cancer. However, for every skin cancer diagnosed, many benign lesions are unnecessarily removed, causing scarring and expense. This study measures the impact of a special confocal microscope (CM) to diagnose skin cancer without surgery. CM is a highly accurate technology but is not widely available. We will measure the reduction in unnecessary biopsies and cost savings of CM, and aim to improve accurate skin cancer diagnosis in Australia.</Plain_Description>

The NT will fund a new RSV immunisation program (nirsevimab) for all First Nations newborns. Nirsevimab protects against RSV for five months, but First Nations children have high levels of RSV-infections for up to 12 months. We will test if a second dose of nirsevimab at six months, versus no dose (single birth dose only), will better protect First Nations children against respiratory infections. </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Children sometimes develop a limp, or difficulty moving a limb. Most of the time this is caused by inflammation, which resolves after a few days. However, a small number of children have more serious causes, such as infection, acute rheumatic fever (with Indigenous children at higher risk), or cancer. This project will collect data and follow up children presenting to 18 Emergency Departments across Australia and NZ to identify the best way to make an accurate and rapid diagnosis.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Immunotherapy before surgery has been established as best practice in stage III melanoma. The surgery is extensive, with frequent complications, significantly impacting quality of life (QoL), at high costs to patients &amp; society. The goal of the trial is to demonstrate that the smaller surgery leads to a similar relapse-free survival, while reducing complications, costs &amp; improving QoL. We aim to provide a less invasive treatment option for patients without compromising their outcomes.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>We have followed 85% of 1074 babies in the Barwon Infant Study to 9 years, and more than 7% have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (autism). Gene expression in placental samples of children diagnosed with autism is strikingly different. We now propose a program of research to create knowledge about how modifiable factors during pregnancy, such as exposure to plastic pollutants and diet, impact the risk of autism via placental function.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a common deadly cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. Up to half of people with KS in Africa die within a year, and many survivors are left with long term disability. In rich countries, chemotherapy is used as effective treatment. However, in Africa this too complex and costly. My work showed that a simple oral immune therapy is an effective treatment of Kaposi sarcoma, and it is now used in rich countries. We will compare this new oral therapy to standard chemotherapy in Africa.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The health and aged care workforce are at risk of workplace injuries during staff-assisted patient or resident movement, and manual handling training alone does not reduce the risk. The new Risk Assessment for moving Individuals SafEly (RAISE) program is different, as RAISE also upskills staff in Dynamic Risk Assessment (DRA), which integrates with organisational systems to reduce or eliminate risks. Our work has shown RAISE-trained staff can effectively embed DRA into clinical practice.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>“Cognitive bias modification” (CBM) is a form of computerised brain training that reduces urges to drink alcohol. Multiple clinical trials have found that CBM helps alcohol dependent patients avoid alcohol during the months after leaving inpatient treatment, yet it is still not used in clinical practice. This project will develop and test ways to make it easy for treatment services to routinely offer CBM, both during and after residential treatment to optimise patient outcomes.  </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Promoting health behaviours in early childhood is important for child health growth and long-term health benefits, in particular, of children from non-English-speaking backgrounds.   This proposal aims to develop an appropriate training program for improving skills and knowledge of primary healthcare professionals in promoting nutrition and physical activity of young children. This national project will develop policy and practice recommendations for children’s optimal nutrition and growth.   </Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Sexually transmissible infections (STIs) are rising in Australia and cause serious complications like infertility and infant death. Most people visit a general practice doctor each year. But doctors may not talk about sexual health care if a patient visits for a different reason. This research will develop a digital tool to remind doctors to talk to patients about STI or HIV and link them to the best information. It will find out if doctors like the tool and if it improves STI or HIV care.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>Managing cardiac patients is increasingly complex. We have shown that a delay in ambulance offloading at hospital raises the risk of death and reattendance. With >1 million ambulance calls in Victoria each year, all cardiac patients are taken to hospital regardless of risk which is costly. We're partnering with health services, government and consumers to introduce risk stratification and virtual care, allowing low-risk cardiac patients to stay at home, reducing transports to hospital and costs.</Plain_Description>

        <Plain_Description>The Australian Stroke Alliance (ASA) is addressing the unmet need of urgent stroke treatment in regional and remote Australia by reshaping prehospital care. In partnership with technology company Micro-X Ltd, the ASA have developed a lightweight brain scanner to detect stroke. We will undertake a world-first study using these brain scanners in air ambulances in remote Australia. This innovation has the potential to transform prehospital stroke care delivery on a national and global scale. </Plain_Description>
