This research will elucidate the mechanisms of this poor heart repair and develop promising therapeutics to stimulate the regrowth of heart muscle. The project will identify the best drug candidate and formulate it so that it can be easily delivered to heart attack patients. The overall goal of this research is to remove roadblocks that prevent the body from healing itself after an injury.

Each year, over 3000 people die by suicide, and half of these people had attend an emergency department (ED) in the year before death, but services failed to prevent suicide. We urgently need to understand what happens to people after they come to hospital so we can improve their MH outcomes. Working with key mental health agencies, results from this study will inform targeted, evidence based strategies to improve MH outcomes.

Most IVF add-ons are not proven to be beneficial or safe, but patients may not realise this as information on the internet is unreliable and exaggerates potential benefits. We will develop a new website that has accurate information about add-ons, based on scientific evidence, and is trusted by IVF patients and doctors. IVF patients and doctors will help us to design it and experts will review the evidence.

This study seeks to define the unique molecular signals driving the activation and function of MAIT cells over the course of their immune response, develop methods to modulate their functions, and test the therapeutic impact of MAIT cell modulation on immunity to infections and tumours using mouse models.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040835|Precision Prevention, Targeted Treatment and Improved Survivorship to Decrease the Burden of Breast Cancer|Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 Australian women. Of all the cancers, breast cancer results in the largest number of years of healthy life lost from death and illness. My research will reduce this unacceptable burden of breast cancer for women and their families. Spanning prevention, through treatment to survivorship, it will facilitate reduced breast cancer incidence, better treatments and enhanced understanding of the effects of new treatments on ovarian function and fertility.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040834|Generating the evidence required to enable health equity for gender and sexuality diverse populations in Australia|Gender and sexuality diverse populations in Australia face higher morbidity rates than their heterosexual peers, with limited understanding due to small, non-probability samples. My goal is to reshape public health strategies by generating robust evidence to address these disparities, identify overlooked issues, and enhance healthcare access. By leveraging large-scale studies, I aim to strengthen the evidence base and develop strategies for improved chronic disease management.

It has harmful effects on pregnancy and health outcomes. This research will address weight stigma in maternity healthcare and guidelines that inform care. It will generate new evidence on women’s experiences of weight stigma and its impacts, update guidelines to be non-stigmatising and implement better care into practice. Eliminating weight stigma from maternity care will improve women’s health outcomes.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040904|Better evidence and translation for healthcare associated infection prevention|1 in 10 people admitted to hospital develop an infection as a complication of their healthcare. These infections lead to significant patient suffering and unnecessary deaths. Current methods for infection prevention and control are complex, inefficient and costly. In partnership with Queensland Health services and patients, I will develop state-of-the-art systems and knowledge translation solutions that inform infection control programs and combat rising infection-associated death rates.

Alarmingly, invasive StrepA infections are increasing in Australia. StrepA induced rheumatic heart disease principally afflicts Australian Indigenous populations. A commercial vaccine to prevent StrepA infection is not available, but in partnership with vaccine manufacturers, my research team will progress StrepA vaccine formulations into clinical development.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040846|Development of Novel Anticoagulants with Improved Safety Profiles for Stroke Therapy|This project will use cutting-edge technologies to discover safe and effective new ‘clot busting’ therapies for stroke. Strokes are caused by blockages in blood flow to the brain, starving the tissues of oxygen and nutrients. One Australian suffers a stroke about every 19 mins, but the only therapy available does not work for many patients. Our novel anticoagulants are expected to dissolve clots without risky bleeding to save lives, prevent disability and reduce the enormous burden of stroke.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040939|Using sodium ascorbate to reduce neuroinflammation and delirium after cardiac surgery|Patients who require cardiac surgery have a 40–50% risk of developing an acute brain injury after their operation. These complications increase the risk of dying after surgery, and can reduce long-term quality of life substantially. A specially formulated solution of mega-dose Vitamin C appears very effective to prevent, or to reduce the severity of this condition. My program of research will establish the best dose of this therapy, how it works, and its safety in large animals and humans
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040918|Thwarting Rare Blood Cancer in Kids with Single-cell Innovation (TRaCKIn)|"My research will innovate new approaches to predict relapse and develop more effective cancer vaccines for children with a rare but deadly form of blood cancer. I will achieve this by tracking unique gene signatures, akin to ""biometric fingerprints"" unique to each child's individual cancer and immune cell, during the treatment and remission phases. This will improve cancer relapse monitoring and tailor cancer vaccine development towards each child, safeguarding and improving their lives."
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040938|Uncovering the molecular mechanisms associated with exercise to develop therapies to treat obesity-related diseases|Obesity can lead to many diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. In contrast, regular exercise can prevent or slow the progress of these diseases. To date, we do not know the precise ways obesity or exercise affects either the progression or prevention of these diseases. This research program will attempt to better understand what obesity and exercise do to the body, so that we can develop new and better drugs to treat diseases associated with obesity.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040943|Advancing evidence synthesis methods to collaboratively improve child health outcomes|To answer health research questions researchers traditionally bring together results from studies published in journals. But often, not all required information is available in these articles. New methods bring together full datasets of previous studies. My research program will advance these methods, looking at how to find and exclude fraudulent or low-quality studies and reduce bias or ‘spin’ in interpretation. I will apply these methods to answer crucial questions on care of premature babies.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040972|Novel Neurobiological Treatment Mechanisms in Eating Disorders|Approximately 1.1 million Australians have eating disorders, but current treatments are ineffective, and developing new medications has stalled. My research will use advanced brain imaging technology to study how new drugs affect brain pathways in eating disorders. I will conduct studies on the impact of tirzepatide in binge eating disorder, ketamine for anorexia nervosa with depression, and orexin levels in bulimia. This work will aid in launching new treatment options for eating disorders.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040955|Nutritional Psychiatry: Clarifying Mechanisms to Support Precision Interventions|Poor diet is a leading contributor to illness and death globally, and mental disorders are a major cause of disability. I have pioneered the field of Nutritional Psychiatry, establishing the link between diet and mental health. My research program will now generate critical new evidence on how diet influences mental health, supporting better interventions and outcomes for people with depression.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040965|Unlocking the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory mesenchymal stromal cells through a refined mode of action|Cell therapy involves injecting specific types of cells into the bloodstream during disease for treatment. Mesenchymal stromal cells are a specialised type of cell that hold great potential in reducing inflammation in disease; however, they have shown mixed success in clinical trials to date. This project aims to uncover how these cells work in the body and discover innovative anti-inflammatory therapeutic targets that will improve patient outcomes.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040971|Transforming Epilepsy Management through Evidence-Driven Approaches|Epilepsy is a major health issue, affecting over 250,000 Australians of all ages. Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcomes, but many Australians experiencing first seizures do not receive care that meets international standards. Additionally, half of those with epilepsy do not take their antiseizure medication as prescribed. My research program will use national healthcare data and interviews with people with epilepsy to find the best ways to improve epilepsy care and close knowledge gaps.

Changes in our DNA that alter RNA splicing can cause disease; however, RNA splicing variants are hard for clinicians to interpret. My research vision is to build tools to interpret RNA splicing variants. These tools will help diagnose more individuals with rare genetic disorders, providing families access to support groups, informed treatment options, knowledge of disease progression, and genetic therapies.

Current influenza vaccines are suboptimal, they need to be updated and administered annually, and provide no protection in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak. This research program will see the development of a novel universal 'one-shot’ influenza vaccine that provides long term protection against both seasonal and newly emerging pandemic influenza strains.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041012|Unravelling immune responses to severe respiratory viral infection and vaccination in humans|We develop robust & long-lasting immune responses to respiratory viral infections, yet some people still fall very ill despite being vaccinated. I will investigate immune responses that protect us from severe & fatal infections; understand why some people fail to generate protective antibodies to the flu vaccine; & identify key biomarkers aimed at reducing influenza disease impact in high-risk groups. This work will improve future vaccination regimens towards influenza & newly-emerging viruses.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040986|Transforming Lives: Transplant for All and One Transplant for Life|Kidney transplantation is a life saving treatment for many patients with kidney failure. However, it is not available to all patients who need one due to limited organ availability. Once transplanted, there are also many challenges including increased cancer and infection risks, and early graft loss from rejection. This program of work will implement novel interventions and strategies to drive sustainable improvements in health outcomes and overall well-being of kidney transplant patients.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041052|Identifying molecular determinants of antiviral immunity conferred by effector T cells|Primary immunodeficiencies arise from an error in a single gene in an individual from birth. As a result, many patients experience complications including increased susceptibility to life-threatening viral infections, severe allergies, and early-onset cancer. My research will uncover the immunological impact of such errors to support the identification of personalised treatments that alleviate symptoms and enhance patients’ quality of life.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041019|Pathways to vision following lesions of the primary visual cortex|Vision depends not only on the eyes, but also on many brain areas. Without the latter the visual information cannot be decoded, and the person becomes blind even if the eyes are spared. For example, when an area named the primary visual cortex (V1) is damaged by stroke or trauma, a type of profound blindness ensues, for which there is no treatment. I will explore how visual information can be channeled to non-damaged parts of the brain, in search of ways to restore vision following V1 damage.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041048|Creating A “Learning Health System” For Eating Disorder Treatment|Eating disorder (ED) treatment is currently not monitored for quality or safety, and yet we know that at least 50% of those who seek treatment have poor outcomes. This research program will embed a digital system to collect and collate clinical outcomes into ED clinics. The data will be used by consumers, clinicians, researchers and governments not only to tailor individual treatment, but to evaluate treatment at a national scale.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2040954|Establishing protective immunity against antigenically diverse viruses|Viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2 keep changing to avoid recognition by the immune system. This research program will study how the immune system responds to different variants, with the goal of informing vaccine design. This work will advance our understanding of viral immunology and significantly improve human health.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041127|Unravelling epigenetic mechanisms to improve immunity|Our immune systems protect us remarkably well from a constant barrage of germs. However, this protection must be finely balanced to not overreact (as in asthma) or leave us vulnerable to infection (as in immune deficiency). My research program aims to understand how DNA is read differently in different cells, termed 'epigenetics', despite all cells of the body having the same DNA code, with the ultimate goal to develop new epigenetic-targeting drugs to restore healthy immunity in disease.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041117|Long-lived remodelling of epigenetic state to treat disease|In normal biology, genes can be switched on or off so that the same set of genes can result in many different cell types. If we can harness the power to switch genes on or off therapeutically then we could treat myriad incurable diseases. Here we will apply a new strategy to switch genes on and off. We will develop novel potential treatments for the neurodevelopmental disorder Prader Willi Syndrome and investigate in which other diseases our approach is suitable.

The program will address 4 of the top priorities for stroke research for stroke survivors by testing 4 new treatments which aim to protect the brain from damage during an acute stroke, reduce the likelihood of having another stroke, and help stroke survivors decide whether it is beneficial to take blood-thinning medicines to prevent another stroke.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041063|Harnessing Precision Medicine to Combat Infections in Transplant Recipients|Organ transplants are life-saving but require long-term medications to block the immune system to prevent rejection. This means transplant recipients suffer enormously from serious, complex infections. My research program aims to improve the lives of transplant patients by using new tests of immune function to optimize the dosing of immunosuppressive medications, predicting and anticipating those at high risk and intervening before infections occur.

Through research led by my team over the past 20 years we now know the infection in Australia is spread by mosquitoes. In this project we will track the pathogen in the environment and eliminate Buruli ulcer by curing the infection in Australian native possums and by innovative mosquito control measures. We will also explore vaccines to prevent Buruli ulcer in humans.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041202|Targeting whole genome duplication as a therapeutic vulnerability in high grade serous ovarian cancer|Ovarian cancer is an area of urgent need for new and effective treatments. I previously found that ovarian cancers which develop whole genome duplication (WGD) early have features that allow cancer cells to hide from the body’s immune system. These patients also have the worst prognosis. My research will explore the differences in ovarian cancer cells with WGD, assess changes linked with WGD even before the cancer is diagnosed, and look for therapeutic targets to treat cancers with WGD.

Currently the only treatment for this disease is surgery, but this has durability and safety limitations. This research program will deliver unique clinical trials to test new ways to treat this problem non-surgically with drugs, counselling, medication optimisation and exercise suited to all Australians.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041152|A new molecular era for dementia: Biomarker discovery through to implementation|Dementia diagnosis is evolving from clinical to biologically informed methods, with biomarkers now crucial for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. My research has shown the immense potential of blood-biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostics. However, there are still gaps to address. Here, I will focus on developing novel biomarkers for non-AD dementias, assess how other health factors affect both AD and non-AD dementia biomarkers, and test how well these biomarkers work in clinics.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041249|Redefining Psychopathology: Empirical Phenotypes Offer a Path to Discovery|It is now clear that traditional approaches to diagnosing mental illness are hindering rather than helping progress in identifying underlying mechanisms, and improving treatment outcomes. My research takes a new approach, following the patterns in how symptoms naturally co-occur to define so-called ‘empirical phenotypes’. The proposed research will compare different diagnostic systems to determine which ones work best for different purposes, and will develop tools for using them in practice.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041205|Understanding the role of an ancient fusogen in malaria parasite fertilisation and transmission|The global effort toward malaria elimination requires an array of tools to prevent, treat and block transmission of the malaria parasite. Blocking transmission involves targeting proteins that are essential for malaria parasite fertilisation in mosquitos, thereby preventing mosquito to human transmission. Understanding how these proteins work and discovering new fertilisation proteins is essential for developing effective interventions, like antibody treatments, to prevent transmission.
http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/2041226|Identification, Validation and Therapy of Autoinflammatory Diseases|Mutations of our genetic code can affect cells of our immune system, leading to a functional loss or gain that can cause recurrent infection, or in some cases, promote autoimmunity and autoinflammation. Our investigation of these inborn errors of immunity will advance the understanding of disease mechanisms, and fundamental workings of our immune system, in order to identify and improve therapies that will potentially treat a range of inflammatory diseases.
