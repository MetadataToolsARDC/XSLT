This project will prepare new versions of the ACCESS Earth System Model and use these to perform climate simulations for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 7 (CMIP7)—a global initiative that informs international climate assessments, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 7th Assessment Report (AR7). \n\nBy developing an Australian-owned model, researchers can better capture local influences like the Southern Ocean’s role in future climate and carbon management and how Australia’s nutrient-limited soil impacts plant productivity and carbon uptake—factors often overlooked in international models. ACCESS ensures Australia has internationally credible tools for negotiations and policy decisions. The project, led by CSIRO in partnership with BoM, Monash University and the ACCESS-NRI, will provide researchers with cutting-edge climate data, supporting climate projections and the nation’s transition to net zero.",

  "description": "As our climate warms, marine heatwaves are becoming more intense and longer lasting. This can have detrimental consequences for ecosystems and industry alike. However, before we can confidently understand change and potential impacts, reliable baseline marine heatwave hazard information is required at scales relevant to environmental managers in the nearshore regions. This project will work to provide marine heatwave hazard maps around southeastern Tasmania to help marine managers make informed planning decisions. \n\nUnderstanding the marine heatwave hazard in the coastal zone  \nMarine heatwaves can disrupt species’ life cycles, alter habitat conditions, and threaten marine biodiversity. While the science around marine heatwaves is becoming well developed for open ocean regions where climate drivers are better understood, in coastal regions —where important habitats for species are located, as well as fisheries and aquaculture operations are concentrated—our knowledge is much less developed. Specifically, in the coastal and nearshore zones, adequately observing or modelling marine heatwaves is more challenging, as the important processes are very complex.   \n\nThis project focuses on the waters around southeastern Tasmania, an ecologically and economically important region experiencing multi-decadal ocean warming at 2-3 times the global average rate. Researchers will use available observations and high-resolution models to provide critically needed marine heatwave hazard baseline information. They will also analyse the movement and survival of key species, such as Eastern Rock Lobster and Long-spined Sea Urchins using particle tracking methods. By integrating multiple data sources, the project will improve understanding of how offshore marine heatwaves can influence the coastal zone and estuaries.   \n\nSupporting adaptation and decision making \nThis research will provide essential guidance for fisheries, aquaculture, and environmental management. For fisheries, the project will identify key retention areas for lobster and sea urchin larvae and assess how marine heatwaves influence their spread. For aquaculture, it will improve awareness to aid planning.  \n\nThe project will map the marine heatwave hazard. By delivering baseline hazard assessments, this work will equip industries and coastal managers with the knowledge needed to interpret local and large-scale background environmental conditions so that marine ecosystem and operations decision-makers are well informed when developing risk profiles for habitats, species or businesses.",

  "description": "As coastal flood risks become more frequent in the future due to climate change, this research provides a fresh approach to making complex data and information more accessible and actionable \n\nUnderstanding coastal flood risks from storm tides and extreme events  \nSea-level rise is increasing the frequency of inundation of coastal places. Events that were once considered acute nuisances are now evolving into recurring issues. In addition to tidal flooding, the rare combination of a major storm surge and high tides, can exacerbate coastal flooding, and with sea level rise can lead to the possibility of major inundation and chronic impacts. This project aims to equip coastal managers, adaptation professionals, and decision-makers with data and information to improve understanding of coastal flood risks from storm tides and extreme events. We will develop case studies for better understanding and practical application to support community engagement and inform adaptation strategies. \n\nEmpowering decision-makers for a resilient future \nCo-developing user-friendly tools, such as flood likelihood overlays, will help stakeholders understand the frequency and likelihood of coastal flooding, enabling more informed decision-making for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation.  \n\nThe project will contribute to improving flood prediction models, including the development of new flood layers and inundation maps tailored to selected case study locations. By fostering collaboration with state governments, First Nations communities, and climate adaptation experts, the project will support the creation of actionable guidance to enhance resilience and facilitate better coastal planning for the future.

  "description": "Advancing Australia’s Earth System Model.\nTo better understand Australia’s changing climate we need a Climate and Earth Systems Model tailored to our conditions and requirements.\n\nACCESS (Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator) is a state-of-the-art climate and earth system model to simulate the entire Earth’s climate. It’s used to understand the behaviour of the climate and its interactions with various components of the Earth system, including the carbon cycle. ACCESS provides important and unique climate data to inform considerations of climate risk, mitigation pathways, adaptation policy and decision-making, for Australia.  \n\nThis project focuses on developing the next generation ACCESS Earth System Model to enhance our understanding of climate processes globally with a focus on the Australian and Indo-Paciﬁc regions. This is to support policy relevant science in line with the Paris Agreement, to underpin regional climate projections, and to contribute to international modelling initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).\n\nOne of the main uses of ACCESS is to provide input for downscaling to derive regional scale climate information for Australia’s states and territories. ACCESS can also be used to explore a range of future climate scenarios at the global scale. Within this project and the Climate Systems Hub it has been used to explore areas such as sea surface temperature projections for the Great Barrier Reef, climate variability, climate stabilisation, including impacts on the Southern Ocean. It can also be used along with other global models to explore the impacts of temperature overshoots on marine ecosystems, to assess the implications of net-zero CO2 emissions on regional climate and to estimate future regional carbon budgets.",

  "description": "Uncovering the uncharted climate trajectories that could shape our future, equipping stakeholders with crucial information for managing climate risk.  \n\nCharting high-impact, lower-certainty climate scenarios \nConventional climate change projections are crucial tools for assessing future climate risks. However, these projections capture a limited range of possible climate futures. Many other plausible scenarios of unknown likelihood, such as greenhouse gas overshoot and stabilisation scenarios, and patterns of sea surface temperature changes in the tropical Pacific, are often not found in these datasets. This project aims to fill some of these critical gaps, offering a more comprehensive view of climate futures. By examining these “uncharted” futures, the research will allow risk managers a greater understanding of what could unfold under a broader range of climate conditions. This will allow them to start to consider what decisions and planning might address the level of risk identified.  \n\nTurning uncharted climate futures into actionable insights \nTo tackle these gaps, the project will apply innovative research methods and expert judgment, co-designing new approaches. The research will explore plausible but currently unaccounted-for scenarios, such as extreme climate trajectories and pattern changes. Research results will be turned into reports, briefings, and visual representations to help build a broader understanding of the risk management space of those previously uncharted scenarios. The project will collaborate closely with key stakeholders, including the Australian Climate Service, to ensure findings are translated into accessible, actionable information. By filling these gaps, the project aims to equip decision-makers with the tools necessary to make informed choices, ensuring that climate adaptation strategies are robust across a full spectrum of possible futures.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub project 'Supporting recovery and management of migratory shorebirds in Australia'. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nCoastal Australia is home to 37 regularly occurring migratory shorebird species, with many protected areas including Ramsar sites designated on the basis of shorebird populations. Many migratory shorebirds are declining rapidly, and hence the focus of conservation efforts at multiple levels of government in Australia and overseas. Excitingly, after decades of decline, many of Australia’s migratory shorebird populations are now showing improving trends (NESP MaC Project 1.21 - Australia’s Coastal Shorebirds: Trends and Prospects). However, we do not understand why the birds’ populations are stabilising, or how these gains can be converted into genuine population recovery to previous population levels. This project will combine analyses on more than a million observations of shorebirds banded in Australia with a comprehensive database of management actions to (i) create an annually updatable dashboard providing the key shorebird population parameters of reproductive output and survival, (ii) build a comprehensive database of conservation management actions for migratory shorebirds, indicating which actions are known to benefit reproductive output and survival, and (iii) create a shorebird management handbook that can be used by practitioners to guide action across Australia and around the East Asian – Australasian Flyway. Outputs will support DCCEEW’s international obligations in relation to Ramsar wetlands, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS), bilateral migratory bird agreements with Japan (JAMBA), China (CAMBA) and the Republic of Korea (ROKAMBA) as well as feed directly into developing the new incarnation of the Australian Government’s Wildlife Conservation Plan for Migratory Shorebirds. Results have a pathway for regional and local implementation through BirdLife Australia’s Migratory Shorebirds Conservation Action Plan.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Annually updateable dashboard providing estimates of reproductive output and survival\n • Searchable database of conservation management actions for migratory shorebirds\n • Shorebird habitat management handbook that can be used by practitioners\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "As coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) continues to degrade, pressure is growing for direct interventions to assist the recovery of corals at important sites. A range of coral restoration and assisted recovery techniques have been trialled overseas and in Australia, however there has not been an evaluation of what will work best in GBR conditions. This project will: \n\n- Summarise and evaluate the success of coral restoration and assisted recovery techniques worldwide and identify the techniques most likely to help the GBR. \n- Experimentally test the most promising techniques. \n- Come up with best practices for post-impact coral reattachment and reorientation. \n- Explore options for training courses, offset models and Indigenous employment.",

  "description": "There is significant Government investment in water quality improvement focused on reducing gully erosion (~$50M), however, there is limited measured data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the remediation approaches. This project is collected land condition, terrain and water quality data from five gully remediation trial sites in the Burdekin catchment. The data demonstrated whether the on-ground investment programs are actually improving measured water quality, and quantified the cost-effectiveness of the various approaches. The measured field data was extrapolated using Lidar, supporting the prioritisation and evaluation of future remediation sites over larger (whole of property) scales. Communication products were developed to provide the evidence needed to increase landholder engagement in remediation programs that are focused on improving water quality runoff to the GBR.\n\nThis project is a continuation of NESP TWQ Round 2 - Project 2.1.4.",

  "description": "This project critically evaluates climate models to improve our confidence in projections of rainfall drivers, and predictions of extreme events like land-falling tropical cyclones under a future climate state. By enhancing our confidence in the modelling, Australia’s climate-related decisions and risk management strategies will be informed by the best possible evidence.  \n\nIncreasing confidence in modelling Australia’s future weather and climate hazards \nGlobal and regional climate models are essential tools to predict climate hazards and extreme events, helping us understand how our world will change in a warming climate. Confidence in the reliability of modelled climate projections for Australia heavily depends on the models‘ capability to simulate Australia’s rainfall, temperature, and climate processes that affect extreme rainfall, such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Under a warming climate, local factors and land surface changes could affect tropical cyclones and the rainfall they bring. This project takes the next step by closely examining climate model simulations to better understand key climate processes and extreme events.\n\nBy assessing past and future trends, the project will refine our understanding of how climate change may shape Australia’s climate. Through detailed case studies, researchers will evaluate climate models against observed events, providing clearer insights into whether current projections accurately reflect future conditions. These findings will support evidence-based policy decisions and improve risk management strategies.\n\nStrengthening confidence in decision-making around future climate hazards through case studies \nAnother key focus is enhancing model evaluation to offer critical insights for climate risk assessors, including the Australian Climate Service (ACS). Improved projections will support governments, industries, and ecosystem managers in making informed decisions on climate risks.\n\nThe project’s findings will also contribute to better forecasting capabilities for climate models like ACCESS, offering more accurate predictions for extreme rainfall, tropical cyclones, and other critical risks. This will help inform responses in areas such as water and ecological management, infrastructure planning, and emergency preparedness — equipping stakeholders with tools to mitigate the impacts of future extreme events.",

  "description": "This project addresses a series of critical initial steps required to develop a cost-effective integrated monitoring program. First, environmental, social and economic elements and indicators will be identified that could be monitored to enable an integrated evaluation of the Long Term Sustainability Plan (LTSP) targets. Second, existing monitoring programs will be evaluated against the newly developed LTSP targets, to ensure that the relevant aspects of these monitoring programs are considered for inclusion in an integrated monitoring program. Finally, the statistical performance of the AIMS Long Term and Marine Monitoring Programs will be evaluated to illustrate how these programs could cost-effectively contribute to an integrated monitoring program.",

  "description": "Over 50 land-sourced pesticides have been detected in waters of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and its catchments. Previous studies on the risks posed by pesticides have focused on five priority PSII herbicides. However, other pesticides are increasingly being used, for which there are few fate, persistence and toxicity data. In order to improve water quality guidelines and assessments of the potential risks posed by these “alternate” pesticides to GBR and its catchments we will quantify their toxicity to freshwater and marine species.",

  "description": "The project will develop a water quality indicator based on benthic irradiance (the amount of light penetrating to the seafloor). Using experiments and field data we will develop irradiance thresholds for measures of ecosystem health, and develop prototype guideline values. The project will develop a new remote sensing algorithm of benthic irradiance, validated against open-water irradiance data. The project will quantify benthic irradiance throughout the GBR, near-daily over 14 years, and assess region-specific drivers of trends including river discharges. The indicator can directly feed into Reef Plan report cards, irradiance as a limiting factor, and about cumulative risks in the context of coral bleaching.",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThis project will address the growing global issue regarding the decommissioning of end-of-life offshore oil and gas (O&G) infrastructure with the aims of building the scientific evidence to support the decisions to either remove structures for onshore disposal (full removal is the default regulatory position in Australia under the OPGGS Act 2006) or leave them in the ocean for re-use as artificial reefs or other purposes (which would require a sea dumping permit under the Environmental Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981). The project will generate a collaborative scientific paper outlining the top pending science questions regarding the decommissioning of offshore O&G infrastructure and will provide a comprehensive road map for the coming decade on research priorities for this topic. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Published open-sourced article within a peer-reviewed scientific journal",

  "description": "This project seeks to understand how local, regional and global oceanographic and meteorological processes influence the severity and spatial variability of thermally driven coral bleaching for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and Torres Strait. All available relevant environmental observations of the recent bleaching events will be gathered to be more easily discoverable to researchers and managers via a gateway/summary webpage. The data will be used to assess how well the eReefs models are modelling the recent warming during bleaching events and then analyse the reasons behind the variations of bleaching response. 3D versions of remotely sensed bleaching products by NOAA and BoM will be produced and a seasonal prediction capability for marine heatwaves will be developed.",

Understanding the values (ecological, cultural, social and economic) of these adjacent systems, and especially the connections and interdependencies between systems, is crucial to effective and efficient protection and management of the globally important natural and cultural values within each system. This project will identify and assess the values of these adjacent systems, and characterise the processes and attributes that influence the values and their connectivity at a regional scale, delivering a resource that can inform cross-jurisdictional planning and management.",

  "description": "The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing increased environmental stress which threatens its functioning. Yet a subset of species are often disproportionately important in maintaining a functioning ecosystem. This project harnesses Queensland’s breadth of reef expertise to deliver timely recommendations on what can be done to strengthen and protect key supportive species. Specifically we ask which species – or functional groups of species – drive processes that maintain a healthy reef. We provide a scientific consensus in support of (1) species’ rankings and recommendations for enhanced protection, (2) informed scenarios for what’s at stake: the consequences of not taking further action, and (3) make recommendations for targeted R&D. We will also suggest activities that can be undertaken by citizen science organisations to help monitor the status of priority species or identify areas of either outstanding value or threat.",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nInvestment in restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems is increasing due to concerns around habitat loss, water quality, decline in fish catches, coastal inundation and erosion, and climate change. Coastal wetlands, including mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses and tidal freshwater forests like Melaleuca have significant capacity to sequester carbon dioxide contributing to blue carbon stocks. They provide habitat for coastal fisheries and a range of biodiversity and are culturally important. This project aims to develop a method, that can be widely used across Australia, to prioritise coastal wetland restoration sites for Blue Carbon projects based on a value-based framework that considers biophysical suitability, balancing of wetland values, condition, regulation and policy adequacy, and economic feasibility. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Spatial data outputs from the Fitzroy Basin QLD, south-west WA and northern Australia analysis [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Project 3.18 – Robust citizen science for reef habitat assessment in support of management. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nBy mobilising tourism vessels and thousands of citizens, the Great Reef Census (GRC) has demonstrated that citizen-based infrastructure can undertake reconnaissance of hundreds of reefs and garner private donor support. While these data are already used by managers, there remain core scientific questions regarding the acquisition, quality, and optimisation of such data for reef management. Here, we create a robust approach to citizen science that can be scaled up to reefs generally. Specifically, our project will (1) maximise the quality of data on key habitats by combining machine and human learning (in partnership with Dell Technologies) while conducting a rigorous testing of data quality, (2), operationalise a field deployment strategy that maximises the value of citizen data for management and mapping and (3) provides annual maps of reef state and ecological importance that feeds into decision-making by marine managers. It specifically responds to MAC Hub priority research areas 2023 (citizen science and/or new technologies in assessing condition and status of marine habitats and species). \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Maps of reef habitat type, reef state, ecological importance of reefs [spatial dataset]\n • GRC data on reef images and reef state [tabular dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "The sugar industry occupies 350,000ha in Reef catchments, applies >55,000t of nitrogen (N) fertilizer annually and is a major contributor of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to Great Barrier Reef receiving waters. There are many potential mechanisms for reducing on-farm Nusage. However, the comprehensive review of N use in sugarcane (SRA/DoE 2014) identified widespread over-use of N fertilizer and recommended adopting production zone yield potential (PZYP) combined with enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) to reduce ’surplus N’ (where applied N>crop requirements). This project utilized existing farm trials at identified N loss ‘hot spots’ to test PZYP as the basis for determining fertilizer N rates and for comparing EEFs with standard N fertilizers for minimizing N losses. Water quality benefits that derive from such practice changes were evaluated. Productivity, economic and environmental indicators validated these strategies for reducing surplus N and produced recommendations for enhanced Best Management Practices.",

  "description": "This project will enable reduced DIN exports from cane lands by developing and promoting a tested framework for commercial insurance businesses to underwrite risk of nitrogen practice change in sugarcane farming. We will work with insurance, other relevant businesses and, potentially, government to determine the methods and precision for assessing risk. We will then develop, in collaboration with insurance businesses, the sugarcane industry and government stakeholders, a technically sound and robust system where the negative impact of practice change on cane yield is distinguished from the year-to-year yield variability. We will pilot (and improve) this system with collaborating farmers, mills insurance businesses and, potentially, government in the wet tropics so that the framework can be operationalised by insurance businesses.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Regional planning in northern Australia: Building a community of practice and sentinel case studies for supporting improved approaches to achieve ESD\". \n\nThis project grows momentum from NESP MAC Hub Project 1.32, which engaged northern Australians on the need for improved regional planning to deliver Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) outcomes. Project 1.32 identified Stage 2 investment to build: (i) a strong regional planning community of practice across the north; and (ii) three longer-standing sentinel case studies for improving regional planning practice within northern regions (WA, NT and Qld). In a methodological sense, the northern Australian community of practice will build on the network foundations established in Project 1.32, and will focus on scanning best practice approaches across the north, exploring innovative ways to communicate these approaches, and ensuring the network is strengthened through regular newsletters and targeted symposiums. The sentinel case study approach will inform policy and practice improvement at the jurisdictional and Commonwealth scales, and will apply Governance Systems Analysis approaches developed under previous NERP and NESP investments. This innovative method employs highly deliberative and evidence-based approaches to the practical analysis of complex governance systems in highly contested landscapes like northern Australia.  \n\nGiven the emerging Commonwealth focus on regional planning effort based on the Samuel review, this project represents perfect timing to focus on best practice, including knowledge management, as well as the opportunity to support emerging Commonwealth, State and Territory efforts regarding these reforms. It particularly addresses the headline issue identified in the MaC Hub 2023 Research Plan which seeks to “address the governance requirements and barriers for regional planning nationally”. This particularly includes an emphasis on northern Australia (i.e. de-risking landscapes). \n\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Case Study Governance Analysis [dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

Reefs are hotspots of conservation as they provide habitat for numerous marine species but are poorly mapped for much of northern Australia. This project will deliver datasets of reef boundaries, satellite imagery optimised for the marine environment, and geomorphic and benthic habitat maps for shallow clear reefs based on improvements to the Allen Coral Atlas. These products are targeted at assisting in the planning and evaluation of coastal development in northern Australia, helping to ensure that sensitive high value habitats are identified and considered in development proposals.

Focusing on the fast-changing underwater systems of the Reef, this research will use advanced technology (including eye tracking and heart rate measurement) to elicit what environmental and experiential attributes contribute to aesthetic value. A Big Data platform using artificial intelligence will be created to assess large volumes of visitor supplied imagery and to map aesthetic value across space and time.",

  "description": "This project will take a novel approach to improving monitoring of environmental and aesthetic conditions in real time by capitalising on information provided through micro-blogs from visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. The data mining will integrate human sensing data (e.g. twitter) with existing monitoring data (including the ‘eye on the reef’), meteorological data, tourism statistics, and others dispersed data sources and a cost-effective monitoring tool will be made available to stakeholders. All Great Barrier Reef stakeholders will benefit greatly from this innovative monitoring system.",

  "description": "The project is developed a water quality indicator based on benthic PAR (light penetrating to the seafloor). The project experimentally estimated irradiance thresholds for ecosystem health for the Great Barrier Reef and developed a new remote sensing algorithm to estimate and map benthic irradiance throughout the GBR. This fed into Reef Plan report cards, RIMReP monitoring, and assessments of drivers of cumulative risks. The project extension focused on: work with stakeholders to embed the products into their workflows; improved the remote sensing algorithm with seasonal and regional cloud corrections; and evaluated an additional benthic light product based on the eReefs models to complement the remote sensing product.",

  "description": "The Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan and Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan 2017-2022 have set ambitious targets for Great Barrier Reef (GBR) water quality improvement. Indeed, Water Quality Improvement Plans (WQIP) for most NRMs in the Great Barrier Reef catchments recognise that complete adoption of sugar cane best management practices will still not be sufficient to achieve the nitrogen load reductions required to meet the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Water Quality Guidelines. Thus additional options need to be considered transitioning agricultural land to other uses is one of those options. Here we capitalise on existing evaluation frameworks developed in NESP TWQ Project 2.1.2, as we aim to;\n\n- identify possible alternate land uses in coastal low-lying cane land, that has a high DIN loss;\n- quantify the economic costs of changing land use, and market mechanisms to incentivise this transition (e.g. Reef Credits); and\n- explore benefits (e.g. farm profitability) of land transition.\n\nThis project will better define options land use change across two NRMs that have different climatic conditions, industry groups, water boards and potentially different land use transitions.",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nIn Australia, the dugong is protected under the EPBC Act 1999 as a listed migratory, and listed marine species, it is also a Matter of National Environmental Significance. The dugong is culturally significant to the coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of northern Australia and has a high biodiversity value. This project includes five activities that will contribute to addressing key knowledge gaps about the spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution, abundance, connectivity and health of dugong populations. The project is designed to inform management in several regions of high value habitat across northern Australia. Transversal to the activities described below is a strong partnership approach with Traditional Owners and members of the wider community. The project will be co-designed, co-produced and will co-deliver research and monitoring outputs. The studies will utilise and advance emerging technologies (e.g., aerial images collected from planes and drones, Artificial Intelligence, population genomics) with the ultimate goal of enhancing data quality, reducing research and monitoring costs, and increasing accessibility of monitoring tools to non-experts.\n\nActivity 1: Assessing trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery surveys along the eastern coast of Queensland\nActivity 2: Assessing the trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery survey in the Shark Bay and Ningaloo/Exmouth Gulf area\nActivity 3: Using population genomics approaches to identify populations and their level of connectivity across northern Australia\nActivity 4; Assessing the body size and body condition of dugongs using drone-based photogrammetry\nActivity 5: Developing community-led dugong monitoring with traditional owners in the Kimberley region.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Dugong sighting location and count data from observer aerial survey data [spatial dataset]\n• Imagery from aerial surveys and photogrammetry\n• Genomic sequencing data and tissue samples\n• Statistical code or script files\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n• Peer-reviewed open access publication",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Developing Traditional Owner community-led dugong monitoring in the Kimberley region. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nDugong are a keystone species with considerable ecological and cultural value across northern Australia. In the Kimberley region of Western Australia, dugongs have been identified as one of the top priorities to monitor in an effort to ensure the population is maintained and traditionally harvested in a sustainable manner. This project aims to have Traditional Owners and ranger groups across the Kimberley use cost-effective and culturally appropriate approaches to (1) fill knowledge gaps on the dugong’s population structure and connectivity at a range of spatial and temporal scales and (2) monitor the animals’ presence, density and habitat use in areas that are ecologically and culturally important to the local community and state and federal managers. This program directly addresses the national priorities of conserving, protecting and sustainably managing biodiversity through research and information management.  \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • dugong distribution and abundance [spatial dataset]\n • aerial survey outputs [imagery & photogammetry]\n • genomic sequencing data \n • code and scripts\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "Reefs vary in their risk of damage, recoverability, and responsiveness to management. Deciding where to prioritise action to maximise reef health is complex. This project delivers a guidance system to implement Resilience-Based Management and demonstrates its application in the Whitsunday and Cairns regions. The guidance system will constitute a desktop software that enables users to prioritise which reefs to manage, and potentially restore, in order to maximise ecological and socio-economic outcomes. Outputs will help GBRMPA (1) make tactical and dynamic decisions; (2) provide scenarios of reef futures to support the 2019 Outlook reporting, (3) support RIMReP by identifying target reef recovery rates; and (4) contribute to the Integrated Pest Management system to control COTS.",

  "description": "Government (e.g. Major Integrated Projects, MIPs) and private investors (e.g. Kilter Rural Group, WWF, and Greening Australia) are increasingly interested in nitrogen reduction projects, particularly via conversion of land to wetlands. Investing in such projects requires understanding the environmental benefits to be accrued and cost-effectiveness. The best way to provide these data is to evaluate already constructed land-wetland conversion sites that resemble what future projects might look like. This project will collect data from previously completed land-wetland conversion sites, on construction and ongoing maintenance costs, and the water quality and biodiversity benefits. In doing so it will provide explicit data for government and private investors to make informed decisions on future investments of this kind.",

  "description": "Australian governments have addressed water quality issues in the Great Barrier Reef (Reef) over the last decade. While much has improved, more is needed. Reef environmental outcomes, however, depend on the interplay among diverse/fragmented governance “activities” (e.g. water allocation, ports-planning, regional NRM). Despite being recognized in the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan (LTSP), there is no coordinated system for benchmarking/monitoring the health of the overall Reef governance system/constituent activities. NERP supported a new method for doing so. This project both delivers short term influence over key Commonwealth and State (i.e. GBR Taskforce) decisions regarding management and investment and engages new LTSP implementation/review structures and stakeholders to build commitment to institutionalizing this method over the longer. Outputs will be directly integrated into and inform five-yearly Outlook reporting.",

  "description": "Report cards are used at various levels to summarise and communicate complex information on GBR health. The effectiveness of Reef Plan is communicated through the annual Reef Report card. In the Reef Report Card, marine water quality is reported using a metric, developed in 2009, based on satellite remote sensing of near surface concentrations of chlorophyll and total suspended solids. This provides a wide spatial and temporal coverage of marine water quality.\n\nHowever, the current water quality metric has a number of issues such that the Independent Science Panel has recently expressed a lack of confidence in it and suggested that a new approach was needed. This proposal outlines a research program to deliver elements of this new approach.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project ' Innovations To Support Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish Control and the Resilience of the Great Barrier Reef'. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef (GBR) faces increasing threats from climate-induced mass bleaching, cyclones, and Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). To maximise the GBR’s capacity to respond to these threats, it is vital to maintain coral cover and target management actions at the locations that best support the resilience of the GBR. Of the major threats to the GBR, only COTS can currently be directly managed. Australia’s COTS control program has already acted to reduce coral mortality at over 450 reefs. This project will develop innovations that increase the efficiency of COTS control, enabling protection of more reefs and more coral. \n\nTo maximise the resilience of the GBR, we must target protection to networks of reefs that can function together to rapidly recover from disturbance. This project will build our understanding of the factors and locations that support the resilience of the GBR. The research will be closely partnered to deliver directly to research-users in the COTS Control Program and the Reef Authority. The innovations developed will progress the adaptive management of the resilience of Australia’s marine ecosystems. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Statistical analysis data\n• Scooter Assisted Large Area Diver-based (SALAD) \n• Coral larval dispersal data\n• Thermal refugia and risk exposure maps\n• GBR ecological model COTS strategy outputs \n• Final technical report with analysed data and summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nNorthern Australia has vast development opportunities but limited knowledge of the environment to inform decision making. This region has globally significant seagrass habitat, supporting dugong, green turtle, and commercially important fish and prawns. Key to managing impacts to species in these habitats is reliable data on seagrass distribution and how this changes over time. Achieving this requires large-scale mapping and a ranger-led monitoring network in remote communities. This project will map seagrass habitats across northern Australia through targeted mapping expeditions in data deficient regions. It will strengthen relationships with coastal communities, build-on existing knowledges and skills, co-design training resources with rangers to undertake monitoring, trial new technologies for monitoring, and synthesise historical and new seagrass data into an open access resource.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Spatial GIS datasets [seagrass surveys]\n • Synthesised historical compilation [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This project aims to assess the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Jasper and associated flooding on inshore coastal habitats (i.e. mangroves, seagrass, coral) in the northern GBR. This project will provide a current consolidated asset assessment that will be compared against previous monitoring/assessment data to determine any impacts of TC Jasper. This will be achieved through high-resolution imagery, rapid on-ground aerial surveys, subtidal surveys using underwater camera systems, and consolidating other available information (i.e., anecdotal/private records). Understanding the impact of TC Jasper on inshore coastal habitats is essential as extreme climate events can cause significant and enduring changes to the condition and resilience of critical habitats of key species, such as dugongs and turtles.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Register of the impacts of an extreme weather event on coastal habitats in the northern GBR\n• Habitat data and metrics [Field surveys]\n• Final technical report with analysed data and summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Synthesizing three decades of seagrass spatial data from Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait have globally significant seagrass habitat that provide food for threatened dugong and turtle, and habitat for commercially important fish and prawns. Key to understanding, managing, mitigating risk, and monitoring seagrass in this remote region is reliable data on seagrass distribution and species composition and how these changes through time. Data on seagrass has been collected in these areas since the 1980s, but data location and storage from these efforts remains disparate, in many cases not publicly available, and in some cases has already been lost. Our study will compile, validate and synthesize historical seagrass spatial data to create a publicly available database accessible on eAtlas. This product will provide end-users with a valuable spatial resource to assist management and monitoring of seagrass in the region. \n\n(i) Identify key seagrass habitat and migration corridors for dugong and turtles in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\n(ii) Identify regions where seagrass information is deficient (knowledge gaps)\n(iii) create a foundations for models assessing exposure to risk (water quality and other environmental impacts, climate change, etc)\n(iv) provide essential information for management, planning, and developing long-term monitoring plans\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • seagrass data [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "Refinement of biological indicators for condition assessment is an immediate priority as highlighted in a recent review of the GBR Marine Monitoring Program (MMP). Seagrass carbohydrate content is an early-warning indicator of water quality impacts. Samples collected quarterly since 2008 will be analysed and used to establish baselines and optimize protocols for applying carbohydrates as an indicator for future monitoring. Furthermore, calibration formulae to convert seagrass percent cover, the principal condition indicator, to biomass will be developed allowing integration across programs critical for the Reef-wide Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program. This project provides excellent value for money because samples have been collected in-kind.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"A pilot study into the movement and dispersal of sawfishes\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe aim of this project is to test the utility of satellite telemetry to elucidate the movement and dispersal in large sub-adult and adult sawfishes, which are a poorly understood life-history phase of this globally and nationally endangered group. In 2021, research and monitoring surveys carried out by DPIRD (Fisheries WA) will provide a unique opportunity to access larger size classes of sawfishes in northern Western Australia. This project seeks to use this opportunity to generate a preliminary dataset on the suitability of satellite telemetry approaches that will guide future research on this taxon to inform the recovery plan.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Raw survey dataset\n • Animal tag gps tracking data\n • Tissue Sample\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "The sugar industry occupies 350,000ha in Reef catchments, applied 58,000t of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in 2014 and is a major contributor of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to Great Barrier Reef receiving waters. There are many potential mechanisms for reducing on-farm N- usage. However, the comprehensive review of N use in sugarcane (SRA/DoE 2014) identified widespread over-use of N fertilizer and recommended adopting production unit yield potential (PUYP) combined with enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) to reduce ’surplus N’ (where applied N>crop requirements). This project will combine with existing farm trials at identified N loss ‘hot spots’ to test PUYP as the basis for determining fertilizer N rates and compare EEFs with standard N fertilizers for minimizing N losses, and to examine the water quality benefits that derive from such practice changes. Productivity, economic and environmental indicators will validate these strategies for reducing surplus N and produce recommendations for enhanced BMP’s.",

  "description": "Australia’s network of Commonwealth Marine Parks plays a central role in conserving marine biodiversity, supporting sustainable use, and protecting cultural and recreational values. With over 60 parks spanning diverse habitats - from shallow coastal areas to deep offshore canyons - effective and adaptive management depends on access to reliable, fit-for-purpose data and data products that reflect the condition of park values and the pressures acting upon them.\n\nThis project improved the capacity to assess the effectiveness of Australian Marine Park (AMP) management by identifying and evaluating priority data and data products required for characterising marine systems and management effectiveness. It worked closely with Parks Australia to assess the availability, quality, and delivery mechanisms of existing datasets, and determined whether these were operationally viable, maintainable over time, and aligned with FAIR data principles. Technical assessments considered consistency of formats, use of standardised vocabularies, as well as machine-readability and the use of national standards for data and collection methodologies.\n\nUsing available data, knowledge, and existing data infrastructure, the project developed methods for estimating the condition of AMP values (excluding cultural values) and for assessing management effectiveness. Recommendations were provided to improve the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of priority data products through national platforms.\n\nOutcomes of the project include a clearer understanding of existing data gaps and a practical foundation for improving future AMP assessments. Parks Australia was equipped with a structured assessment of current data suitability and availability, a demonstration of condition estimation methods, and strategic recommendations to enhance data delivery and alignment with park management cycles. This work directly contributes to the Marine and Coastal Hub’s Protected Place Management Initiative and supports national efforts to build integrated data systems for marine estate monitoring and reporting.",

  "description": "Understanding cumulative impacts from multiple stressors will be critical for successful management of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) under the Reef2050 Plan. This project produced experimental analyses of concentration-response relationships for selected species under broad, controlled envelopes of local stressors at different climate scenarios. Results informed assessments of ecological risks, and management opportunities for a range of activities in the coastal zone and on the GBR. In the project-extension used exposure maps and ecological models, based on our developed and existing databases and experimental results, advancing our understanding of the contribution of individual disturbances in a cumulative framework (including both acute and chronic disturbances) to the current status of the reef. In turn, this new knowledge will inform management on setting future water quality thresholds, identifying catchments and regions as priorities for management action aimed at ameliorating impacts to reef health and building resilience for large-scale cumulative disturbances.",

A combination of satellite imagery, community consultations facilitated by OzFish and The Nature Conservancy, and Traditional Owner Knowledge will be used to develop a comprehensive map of past and present oyster reefs and underpin DCCEEW assessments of future protection and restoration needs. Full assessments of reef condition at selected sites will be used to develop rapid assessment methods suitable for estimating oyster populations, supported biodiversity, habitat preferences and settlement substrates to inform future management, monitoring, and conservation status of tropical oyster reefs. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Locations of shellfish reefs [point spatial dataset]\n• Full characterisation of 7 shellfish reef sites in Queensland, Mackay to Gladstone region Queensland that include 3D photogrammetry, polygon boundaries with site attribution based on Queensland Intertidal and Subtidal Ecosystem Classification Scheme. [polygon spatial dataset, drone scans]\n• Photogrammetry imagery [raw images]\n• Historical shellfish reefs identified from Trove records and from Traditional Owner discussions [point spatial datasets]\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nTo improve sawfish reporting and obtain an estimate of sawfish abundance and stock structure, a large-scale collaborative project is proposed between industry, State and Commonwealth agencies and lead research institutions to gather tissue samples from across northern Australia. The project will have a focus on developing trust between research and the commercial fishing industry that will achieve the following:\n\n-\tIndustry led reporting and sampling programs will be established throughout Australia’s northern fisheries. \n-\tTissue samples will be used to assess sawfish abundance and stock structure using Close-Kin Mark-Recapture (CKMR). \n-\tEstimates of post-release survival will be obtained from satellite tagging and improved reporting. \n-\tData on abundance and post release survival will be used to assess the sustainability of sawfish bycatch.  \n\nThe research also aims to improve reporting of sawfish along with other EPBC listed species in northern Australian fisheries. If enough tissue samples are collected, close kin mark recapture will enable estimates of adult population size for four species of sawfish. Post release survival and abundance estimates will be used to determine the sustainability of sawfish captured as bycatch in state, territory and Commonwealth Fisheries. Improved estimates of bycatch, population connectivity, adult abundance and post release survival were identified as the highest research priorities in the Sawfish and River Shark multispecies recovery plan. \n\nWithin Australia, three out of the four occurring species are listed as Vulnerable and Migratory under the EPBC act (Pristis pristis, P. zijsron and P. clavata). The fourth Australian species, narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) is listed as a Migratory species. Both A. cuspidata and P. pristis are currently under nomination to be up-listed to Endangered under the EPBC act. The Freshwater Sawfish Pristis pristis is also listed in the Threatened Species Strategy - 100 priority species for fish. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Sawfish catch data  [spatial dataset]\n • Tissue samples and sequencing data \n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "The project will use novel analytical techniques/instrumentation to accurately quantify, for the first time, key proximal stressors associated with dredging/spoil disposal (i.e. sedimentation, light quantity/quality, suspended sediment concentrations) and will determine how these parameters vary with increasing distance from dredging. We will then test the response of corals, sponges, seagrass and algae to environmentally relevant/realistic conditions over appropriate time-frames. Matrices of hard data will be generated to derive water quality thresholds for key habitat forming organisms and for use as input parameters for pressure field modelling (including cumulative-impact modelling). This will dramatically improve risk assessment processes, provide greater surety for regulators and proponents, allow more informed decision-making and inform future dredging policy.",

  "description": "Runoff from the Fly River in Papua New Guinea (PNG) influences water quality conditions in the Torres Strait region. Recent work (NESP Project 2.2.1 and 2.2.2) has clearly demonstrated that this influence is largely constrained to the northern Torres Strait, as far east as Bramble Cay and at least as far west as Boigu Island. The southern extent of influence is considered to be limited to within 40-50km of the PNG coast in the western areas, and around 80km in the eastern areas. The intensity of this influence, and the potential ecological impacts, are still not well understood. Trace metal concentrations are higher in the northern Torres Strait around Boigu and Saibai, however it is not clear whether this enrichment is natural or the result of mine derived inputs of trace metals. Further investigation is required to understand the prevalence and frequency of the extension of the Fly River plume into the northern Torres Strait, and further characterisation of plume constituents, particularly sediment and trace metals in comparison to previous results including the Torres Strait Baseline Study.",

  "description": "Working in partnership with staff from the Australian Government’s Department of the Environment (DotE), and the Queensland Government’s Departments of Science Information Technology and Innovation (DSITI) and Environment Heritage and Protection (DEHP), this project will use data collected from land managers and elsewhere to critically evaluate the way water quality (WQ) improvement programmes are ‘marketed’. It will use insights from those evaluations to inform the reconfiguration of marketing and engagement strategies associated with programmes scheduled for roll-out during 2017, demonstrating methods for monitoring and assessing the extent to which these different Programmes and changed strategies improve adoption and alter behaviours.",

  "description": "Recent global experiences suggest that spatially identifying and prioritizing landscape ‘hotspots’ of pollutant generation for management intervention, and small catchment-scale water quality monitoring in collaboration with landholders linking water quality with specific management practices, are among the most promising strategies for reducing water quality pollution. This project will combine recent hotspot identification in GBR sugarcane catchment of the Russel/Mulgrave with targeted cane farmer interaction activities (related to sub-catchment and localized monitoring activities), focusing on emerging monitoring technologies (real-time water quality monitoring) to link farmer on-farm practices with feedback from sub- catchment water quality measurements. The use of both scientific and citizen science monitoring approaches will deliver robust feedback loops to enable farmers to directly link their activities with water quality conditions. The project will focus on on-farm practice improvements in highest priority catchments to achieve maximum benefits to GBR health from catchment management actions.",

  "description": "In early 2016, extensive dieback of mangrove forests was recorded along the southern and western Gulf of Carpentaria coastline. Landsat analysis suggests that 7,400 hectares of mangrove forest suffered dieback over a relatively short and synchronous time period around November 2015, along a >1,000km wide front from Karumba in the east to Limmen River in the west. Recent field visits to a limited range of affected sites suggest that a relatively low percentage of trees have recovered and most are dying/dead. This is the largest event of natural dieback of mangroves ever recorded in the world. This project will provide a survey, description and analysis of the extent of the dieback across its range, as well as examining patterns of dieback. The assessment will include training and participation of local Indigenous ranger groups in mangrove assessment and monitoring methods, as well as providing recommendations for recovery, potential intervention, future monitoring and further studies. A synthesis workshop will also be held to present the findings of the assessment to a wide audience.",

  "description": "The 2020 Independent Review of the EPBC Act (the Samuel Review) states that “Decision-makers, proponents and the community do not have access to the best available data, information and science.

Immediate investment in the information supply chain is needed to support reform. We can't wait until perfect data is available. What is missing at the moment, is the step required to routinely turn well-managed marine research data into marine environmental data and products, that can be consumed by the EIA national environmental data supply chain and made available for use in SOE reports, Environmental Economic Accounts, environmental assessments, and tracking of environmental trends and outcomes.\n\nThis project will address that gap by (a) identifying priority datasets currently managed as research data and (b) building the additional information infrastructure required to (c) routinely deliver marine environmental data and products that are assessment ready, in line with the Nature Positive Plan.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n\n• Final technical report with analysed data and summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This project aims to develop methodologies for assessing cost-effectiveness and identifying key drivers of variation in cost-effectiveness in challenging data situations. It will use these methods to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various completed programs aimed at reducing nitrogen runoff from cane production in Reef catchments. Additionally, the project will identify key barriers and enablers of engagement and lasting behavioral change within recent and current programs. It will compare and contrast different evaluation methods to create an adaptive management evaluation tool for measuring engagement during ongoing programs. Ultimately, the project seeks to inform future investment decisions by identifying characteristics of cost-effective projects that successfully engage stakeholders and promote lasting behavior change.\n\nIn summary, this project will:\n\n1. Develop methodologies for assessing cost-effectiveness and for identifying key drivers of variation in cost-effectiveness in data-challenging situations \n2. Use developed methods to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a range of completed programs for reducing nitrogen runoff from cane production in Reef catchments\n3. Within recently-completed and current programs, identify key barriers and enablers of:\n  a. Engagement\n  b. Lasting behavioural change\n4. Compare and contrast evaluation methods (targeted individual approach compared and contrasted with a within project stakeholder approach) to deliver an adaptive management evaluation tool for measuring engagement whilst programs are on-going.\n5. Inform future investment decisions by helping to identify key characteristics of cost-effective projects that will successfully engage stakeholders to deliver lasting behaviour change.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub project Mapping Sea Country and investigating conservation and restoration opportunities along the Kakadu coast and Garig Gunak Barlu National Park. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThis project addresses the need for contemporary biodiversity and habitat data in the Garig Gunak Barlu National Park (Cobourg Peninsula) and coastal Kakadu National Park, essential for effective Sea Country planning and management. Successful co-management of protected areas requires strong support from the government to enable local communities to have autonomy in decision-making to benefit both the environment and livelihoods. The research focuses on a two-way knowledge transfer process to integrate Western science and Traditional Owners' knowledge to improve knowledge on the extent, condition, and biodiversity of coastal ecosystem habitats under current management and threats. This will empower Traditional Owners to make informed decisions on managing their coastal ecosystems, including restoration opportunities under emerging environmental markets, to improve the resilience of coastal communities and ecosystems under environmental changes while enhancing livelihoods. \n\nTo achieve this, researchers will collaborate with Traditional Owners to map coastal habitats, assess the biodiversity of coastal habitats, and evaluate environmental changes due to sea level rise and feral ungulate impacts. Outputs include co-authored publications, visually engaging materials, and a co-designed mapping project. Outcomes include better management of Kakadu National Park and Cobourg Peninsula by empowering Traditional Owners with enhanced knowledge that they can use to make on-ground decisions that benefit their communities and biodiversity conservation. This collaboration ensures that Traditional Owners' perspectives guide the management and preservation of culturally significant sites while exploring socio-economic opportunities in emerging environmental markets.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Biodiversity and habitat data for the Cobourg Peninsula and coastal Kakadu regions [field surveys & analysis]\n• Collaborative mapping with Traditional Owners\n• Assessment of potential risks to cultural values from sea-level rise and feral ungulates on coastal ecosystems\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "Accurately mapping gullies at high resolution and quantifying their key attributes is the critical first step in the process of prioritising and designing rehabilitation solutions. At least 40% of the  accelerated erosion that is contributing to poor water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)Lagoon is sourced from gully erosion, demanding effective management and rehabilitation of  these features. Current gully maps across the GBR are low resolution and overly simple,providing no differentiation between gully type. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is now widely recognised as being the best way to accurately map gullies at a landscape scale at a suitable resolution for management planning. Given the large volume of LiDAR data now becoming available, this project will develop and apply automated tools to enable the location of gullies to be extracted from LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), along with key attributes of the gullies enabling them to be grouped into classes of similar gully types to aid prioritisation, management and catchment modelling.",

  "description": "In this project we will compile a database of gullies from across Queensland as a tool for communicating the diversity of gullies that exist in the landscape, but also the sommon elements from within this diversity, where they exist. Using this database we will develop a gully classification system to ensure that there is a common language used by researchers, land holders, land managers and practioners when identifying gullies for management intervention. This will also form the basis for subsequent automated gully mapping according to gully type. We will also develop a first order decision tool to guide land managers towards the sorts of management options that may be appropriate for the gullies in question. Whilst this will not be a design guideline, it will help to ensure that the range of management options are narrowed down by managers before specialist advice is sought. A checklist of design considerations will also be developed that will ensure that managers undertake the appropriate level of design work for the required intervention. To some extent this project will document and formalise the knowledge and decision making processes that are currently undertaken by the specialst technical advisory team to the Reef Trust Programme.",

  "description": "Landholder concerns surrounding the credibility of broad-scale water quality monitoring and modelling initiatives in the GBR catchment area is emerging as one of the key cane industry engagement challenges for promoting significant farming practice change, and delivering water quality improvements. Based around small, sub-catchment scale water quality monitoring in a key cane growing region of the GBR catchment, Project 25 utilises a bottom-up approach to integrated sub-catchment monitoring and intervention to identify ‘hot spot’ sub-catchments through localised water quality monitoring. The Project emphasises industry ownership and control of monitoring design, and delivery of locally targeted water quality data to provide confidence in on-farm decision making and practice change.",

  "description": "The past two years have seen unprecedented coral bleaching on the GBR but the consequences on biodiversity and genetic diversity are not yet known. This project will address the following questions: \n\n1) Has bleaching resulted in a loss of genetic diversity in three coral species?\n2) Do surviving populations contain genetic signatures of adaptation to bleaching temperatures?\n3) What is the prevalence of heat tolerant photo-symbionts within surviving corals and in the environmental pool?\n4) Are heat tolerant Symbiodinium communities and host genetic variants correlated with ambient environmental and recent bleaching conditions? \n\nHigh throughput genomic sequence variance analysis will identify genes in corals and Symbiodinium types associated with bleaching tolerance. Through correlations with environmental variables we will develop a spatially explicit understanding of the distribution and abundance of stress tolerant coral genes and symbionts ( in hospite and free-living) to identify key coral populations for protection, key reefs for resilience management and potential breeding stock for use in reef restoration activities.",

  "description": "Organic carbon has traditionally been poorly studied in marine systems, but recent studies suggest that GBR microalgae can utilise organic matter, and that eroded soil carbon parameters can ameliorate marine algal responses to catchment nutrients. This suggests that organic carbon may play a more important role in marine ecosystems than previously thought. Additionally, GBR organic carbon concentrations are increasing, but the mechanisms are unclear. The proposed study would review the literature, develop a conceptual model, and undertake data analysis on organic carbon in the GBR and catchments, and examine links to ecosystem effects. This will improve monitoring and management of water quality in the GBR.",

Using SeaSim experiments and field data, we examine which WQ parameters (nutrients/light/turbidity) affect corals’ thermal tolerance, and assess how temperature and WQ exposure histories affected coral bleaching and recovery during the 2016 bleaching event. We will refine the eReefs model to derive WQ management scenarios expected to maximize coral survival in a warming climate.",

  "description": "Building on the work of the work of the GBR RIMReP Program Design Group, this project will develop cost-effective indicators and metrics for human dimension outcomes, objectives and targets in the Reef 2050 Plan, consistent with the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. It will add value to and ensure continuity with information collected through the Social and Economic Long-Term Monitoring Program for the Great Barrier Reef (SELTMP). The project will: determine potential and extant indicator sets; evaluate data collection cost-effectiveness; determine thresholds (where appropriate); and provide guidelines for a collaborative approach for developing grading scores, using multiple lines of evidence to rate progress towards Reef 2050 Plan targets, objectives and outcomes.",

The project involves a review and evaluation of summary data about NRM projects that have been funded recently to address water quality issues. By pooling the data across NRM regions and different activities, it will be possible to identify the distribution of cost/outcome ratios. From this, potential benchmarks can be established (e.g. 75% of sediment reduction actions are less than $xxx/tonne, 95% are less than $XXX per ton). It also provides some identification of the most cost-effective strategies across actions and regions.",

With stakeholder input, we will develop an initial framework to guide future investment in riparian remediation works.",

Also valuable is the ability to reliably “drill” down from large-scale (World Heritage Area) to small-scale estuaries and meadows. TropWATER provides a composite map of seagrass for the GBRWHA available through eAtlas, GBRMPA and Pangaea. However this layer has not been updated since 2010 and is missing changes from important areas and extensive new data, and provides no meadow-specific information. This project will recompile existing GIS layers, update with 2010-2015 data, and provide meadow-specific information.",

The project will produce experimental analyses of concentration-response relationships for selected species under broad, controlled envelopes of sediments, turbidity, nutrients, light, salinity and temperature. Based on new understanding of threshold exposure values, existing and new field data we will produce exposure maps for individual stressors and explore techniques to summarize those into cumulative exposure maps. Results will inform spatial and temporal assessments of ecological risks, and management opportunities for a range of activities in the coastal zones and inshore GBR waters.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - Project 3.4 – Better Management of Catchment Runoff to Marine Receiving Environments in Northern Australia. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThere are many catchments in northern Australia where increased catchment development is proposed.  This is largely in the form of irrigation development, but also increased cattle stocking rates. Given the relatively low levels of such development in many catchments to date, there is a strong desire to maintain the integrity of coastal and marine receiving environments after the implementation of future developments. The baseline understanding of water quality in receiving marine environments and in the contributing catchments is very limited across much of northern Australia, making management and other development decisions very challenging.  However, there are examples of intensive grazing and irrigation developments in northern Australia, e.g. in the Lower Burdekin Delta, adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef coastline, where lessons can be learnt to fast-track understandings and management and set testable hypotheses about the potential impacts of development in other northern catchments. This project aims to take advantage of these existing examples to improve the quality of decision-making around the impact of terrestrial runoff on the marine environment, providing a template for decision-makers.  \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • River plume modelling [spatial dataset]\n • Estimated river plume sediment and Chlorophyll loads [modelling dataset]\n • Mangrove extents remote sensing [modelling dataset]\n • Primary production response to nutrients in estuaries [experimental dataset\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This project will develop the partnerships and the institutional framework for implementing large scale innovative rehabilitation works which aim to directly reduce sediment supply from the large alluvial gullies on the lower Bowen River. These gullies are the largest single source of suspended sediment loads into the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The project will work directly with Glencore and Q Coal, who are some of the largest grazing landholders along the section of the Bowen River with the highest concentration of large alluvial gullies. The central premise underpinning the strategy is that alluvial gully rehabilitation is more akin to mine site rehabilitation, and such techniques are more appropriate for tackling this major GBR sediment source than grazing BMPs. The strategy aims to draw upon the mine site rehabilitation experience and expertise within these two major Queensland mining companies, applying and adapting mine rehabilitation approaches to the rehabilitation of alluvial gullies.",

Applying quantitative tools developed for ecotoxicology and water quality guidelines, we will investigate critical interactive effects, environmental thresholds and their uncertainties, and their application in risk assessments. In addition, we will develop a roadmap that clearly articulates the steps towards a management framework to assess and manage the cumulative impacts of multiple local stressors within the context global pressures on the GBR.",

In 2007-08, a water quality pilot tender was trialled in the Lower Burdekin River area, funded by the Australian Government through the National Market Based Instruments and co-funded and administered by the NQ Dry Tropics. This project will collaborate with NQ Dry Tropics and engage with tender participants to review design, operational, administrative and other matters of the trial. It will evaluate the effectiveness of the tender to achieve long-term change and identify strengths as well as opportunities for improvement.

  "description": "While coral geochemistry records are widely cited as evidence for increased suspended sediment loads delivered to the Great Barrier Reef since the 1850s, there has been little replication or quantification of the records. Indeed, most records are based on cores collected prior to the year 2000 when limited catchment monitoring data existed to ‘validate’ the interpretations that certain trace element ratios provided proxies of annual sediment loadings. This project will analyse the geochemistry of coral cores collected in 2012 from sites in the central GBR and compare the ratios to measured sediment and particulate nutrient loads from the Burdekin River.",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe proposed National Indigenous Environmental Research Network (NIERN) is an Indigenous-led strategic initiative to establish a community of practice that supports current environmental research needs and priorities, enhance future research agendas, mobilise investment opportunities, bolster the impact and durability of research outcomes and empower Indigenous Australians to participate in the national environmental scientific research agenda.  This project will experiment with conceptual models for establishing a working NIERN to provide evidence that will guide Indigenous organisations, policy makers and researchers that aim to support Indigenous leadership and participation in environmental research.  \n\nThe NESP 2020 review reported that “Indigenous peoples seek earlier involvement in land and sea country research. This means being formally included in the project design, development and delivery.” \n \nThe project team will work with Indigenous organisations, government agencies and researchers across Australia to provide a national perspective of current processes used to establish new research priorities and projects and use case studies to explore how Indigenous led approaches could augment these projects through Indigenous participation at all project stages.    \n\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Mapping dataset [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Developing an Integrated Pest Management Framework for Feral Pigs in Coastal Environments. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nFeral pig populations are recognised as a current and future threatening process across most of northern Australia’s species and ecosystems. They severely impact 1) threatened species, such as marine turtles, with up to 90% of egg and hatchling mortality attributable to feral pig predation, 2) culturally important places and 3) coastal wetlands, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. To date, feral pig control efforts across northern Australia are small-scale. What data we have suggests pig populations remain high, despite the significant annual investment in control, and there is currently no published evidence that quantifies a predictable relationship between control activities that reduce feral pig populations and the reduction of impacts in different habitat types. A new approach is needed. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a well-established approach to pest management in agricultural contexts and, over the last decade, has been successfully adapted for and applied to protecting biodiversity from invasive pest species. The aim of the project is to develop an IPM approach for effective feral pig control for biodiversity and cultural values protection, in coastal wetlands and ecosystems in northern Australia. The science-based IPM approach, informed by workshops with stakeholders and experts, will be implemented in up to three case study areas, principally by Indigenous Land and Sea management organisations and their partners, with data-driven analysis of effectiveness and recommendations for future evolution of the Strategy. This project addresses the Australian Government’s national environmental priorities through mitigating impacts on threatened species, innovation in monitoring and increasing the participation and capacity of Traditional Owners and stakeholders.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • feral pig management case study sites [spatial dataset]\n • aerial survey data and observational data [tabular, imagery]\n • model [software]\n • final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria Marine Park was only recently declared in 2013. The zoning plan for this marine park, which permits trawling within a specific trawling zone is due for renewal by 2028. There is a strong need to collect, analyse, synthesise and make publicly available information on the values and conditions of key habitats within the Marine Park, such as recently identified patch reefs and coral reefs, to contribute to this upcoming review of the management plan for this marine park.\nThe limited scientific information that is available on the values of this marine park is hard to access and much of it has not been analysed or written up. In addition, the Traditional Owners hold much valuable information about the ecological and cultural values that should inform future park management decisions. This project aims to gather, synthesise and report on existing scientific data and information about coral and patch reefs in the marine park.  This information will be presented to the Traditional Owners and other relevant stakeholders at community meetings or workshops.  Documenting cultural values of the reefs in this marine park is beyond the scope of the current project and would require considerable further engagement with Traditional Owners.  However, it is anticipated that presentation of existing scientific and biophysical data at community meetings will start this process.  We will produce visual (e.g. photos and videos) outputs that illustrate the values of these reefs, in order to better inform stakeholders involved in decisions about future park management.\n\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Coastal seagrass of the Gulf of Carpentaria: building knowledge and capacity as a foundation for long-term monitoring. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria has a globally significant seagrass habitat, supporting dugongs, green turtles, and commercially important fish and prawns. Key to managing impacts to species in these habitats, including indirect impacts through land use within southern Gulf catchments, is reliable data on seagrass distribution and how it changes over time. Achieving this requires large-scale mapping and a ranger-led seagrass monitoring program. This project will map intertidal seagrass habitats from the western boundary of the Nijinda Durlga (Gangalidda) and Thuwathu/Bujimulla Indigenous Protected Areas to the Bynoe River near Karumba. This mapping focuses on data-deficient regions along the mainland coastline of the southern Gulf. Surveys will be co-designed and undertaken with rangers. New technologies for monitoring using drones will be collaboratively tested in key locations for ongoing monitoring of coastal habitats by rangers. This will value-add to surveys being conducted around Mornington Island and the Gilbert River in 2023 and contribute towards the development of a regional baseline of seagrass for the Gulf of Carpentaria.  \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Seagrass datasets for the Gulf of Carpentaria [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nWild livestock (particularly pigs, buffalo and cattle) are one of the primary threats to coastal ecosystem values in northern Australia.  Wild livestock poses significant threats to cultural and livelihood values on Indigenous managed and owned lands and impact threatened species, water quality and other elements of biodiversity.  Recent research has highlighted the importance of feral animal impacts on coastal wetlands and ecosystems that have implications for greenhouse gas accounts and other important national environmental assets such as mangrove restoration, coral reefs, marine turtle nesting and wetlands values.   \nResearch is being done on feral animal impacts on several prominent and important values including carbon stocks, marine turtle depredation and sediment loads impacting coral reefs and seagrass.  This research has direct relevance to regulated and voluntary carbon and biodiversity markets. The development of new carbon abatement and sequestration methodologies and associated biodiversity protection markets could lead to economic opportunities for Indigenous owned and managed assets in northern Australia.  However, in the absence of Indigenous leadership in the research that underpins method development, there is a risk that the potential economic and social benefits of these new methods won’t be realised, will erode Indigenous rights and limit local participation in long term management and monitoring of threats.  \n\nThis project will support the development of Indigenous led methods for feral animal management with the aim of establishing methods that account for the values and cultural boundaries that underpin activities on the Indigenous estate.  We will do this research in partnership with Indigenous organisations that have long term feral animal management programs, developed with Traditional Owners and operating within the cultural and environmental boundaries of the homelands they manage.  \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Map Indigenous land management tenure across northern Australia [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n • Research Paper [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Project 3.20– A National Approach to Indigenous Engagement in Australia’s Blue Carbon and Environmental Markets. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nBlue Carbon and Environmental markets, and their related environmental policy are rapidly evolving to meet National carbon reduction targets. In Australia, they’re emerging markets with great potential to improve carbon sequestration and restore biodiversity and cultural values. However, swift market growth infers the potential for perverse outcomes without proper regulation and processes implemented alongside. Corresponding regulation and processes are not yet in place to ensure Indigenous engagement is conducted in a legitimate, respectful, and empowering manner.  \n\nThe project proposes to coordinate a national Indigenous engagement approach for Blue Carbon and where appropriate include discussions on other Environmental market projects. This process will capture the wide-ranging rights and interests of Indigenous peoples and communities across jurisdictions and ensure empowerment in the Blue Carbon market. A key output from this research will be a document that outlines leading practice Indigenous engagement principles learned through a process of consultation with key Indigenous groups across Australia. It will be submitted to the Commonwealth government alongside proposed new Blue Carbon methods to enable efficient implementation that is ethical and in accord with leading practice principles of Indigenous engagement. The Blue Carbon market provides an opportunity for Indigenous community economic gain amidst complex legislation, tenure, resource ownership and co-benefits that haven’t been investigated in detail. Projects for the proposed Ungulate Method (Project 3.8) will occur on Aboriginal-owned land and mixed tenure where Indigenous people hold significant values and interests. Ensuring, Indigenous peoples rights, equity, and that principles of free, prior, and informed consent, are at the fore front of projects, leading practice Indigenous engagement is essential. The project notes that the legislative framework for the Blue Carbon market and how it relates to Indigenous peoples is different to other emerging environmental markets and it is likely to inherently limit the outcomes of this project.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Mapping tenure of Blue Carbon resources  [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"The role of dugong and turtle grazing in Torres Strait seagrass declines\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nDramatic declines in seagrass meadows in the Torres Strait Western Cluster were recorded in 2019 and 2020. These meadows are culturally important and represent significant foraging grounds for green turtles and dugongs. This project will use a short-term field study to investigate the role of megaherbivore grazing in two key locations where seagrass declines have been most dramatic. This project has been co-developed with the TSRA, Sea Rangers and Goemulgaw PBC in response to community concerns about seagrass declines and the implications for the totemic megaherbivores they support. The results will inform Traditional Owner led dugong and turtle management plans and help direct actions for remediation as required. \n\nOutputs\n • Field experiment assessing the whether reductions in seagrass cover at Mabuyag and Orman Reefs is due to grazing from Turtles and Dugongs. The experiment consists of cages over patches of seagrass that exclude grazers. The seagrass canopy and biomass is then compared with control patches [spreadsheet data].\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Scoping Study: New Approaches to Marine Monitoring\".\n\nAustralia’s has the third largest marine estate of any country in the world. Much of our marine and coastal resources are in offshore or sparsely populated areas meaning that our ability to monitor and assess our environmental resources and values is particularly challenging. To maximise our understanding of our marine and coastal environment, we need to take advantage of emerging technologies and approaches. This includes citizen science, community monitoring and Indigenous Rangers. In particular, it is expected that these groups will utilise the same technologies as mainstream science, thus these emerging technologies can bridge the gaps between science and community science to operate in unity. This project provides a series of workshops and engagement processes to best explore how to most effectively deploy technologies and community science programs to achieve maximum benefit and synergy in environmental monitoring.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Final report with analysis and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\nThis record consists of 4 parts: Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D. The metadata record for this project is a summary of the entire project.\n\nPart A: Great Reef Census - a case study to integrate citizen science data into research output for marine habitat management\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nTo maximise our understanding of our marine and coastal environment, we need to take advantage of emerging technologies and approaches. This includes citizen science, community monitoring and Indigenous Rangers. Technology has greatly reduced the gap between mainstream science and community science to the point they may become almost identical in some integrated programs, especially when involving collection of in-field information. The challenge for science is to integrate with the vast opportunities afforded by this congruence.\nThe Great Reef Census (GRC) is an established citizen science innovation project, designed to pilot new ways of capturing reconnaissance citizen science data. By using citizen scientists to both collect and analyse reef images, as well as a team of professional scientists to ensure program rigour, the project is an innovative approach to assessing Great Barrier Reef health that complements and enhance existing monitoring programs.\n\nThe aim of this project is to demonstrate a citizen science approach can effectively fill gaps in knowledge when assessing marine habitats to improve management outcomes. As a case study, it will demonstrate how citizen science data can be integrated into the monitoring programs across Australia’s marine and coastal environments using new digital technology platforms. The project will also complement ongoing GBR-based research and provide critical knowledge gaps through end-user engagement with GBRMPA’s CoTS Control Program and Australia’s reporting on the health of the GBR.\n\nOur study will 1) scrutinise, validate and synthesize expert versus citizen scientist analyses of geo-referenced images collected during the Great Reef Census Year 1 field campaign and using the analysis platform, and 2) explore a re-structured online analysis platform that integrates machine learning and citizen science to extract more output from a growing image library collected during field efforts. The end product will provide a case-study evaluation of the benefits and capability of citizen-science programs as well as assisting decision-making capacity based on real-time broad spatial scale information on the Great Barrier Reef. The output will provide a demonstrated case study of meaningful citizen science application to assess marine habitats which can be applied more broadly to tropical marine habitats.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Synthesis R data package\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\n\nPart B: NESP Marine and Coastal Hub scoping study: New approaches to monitoring.\n\nObservations of marine species have rapidly diversified over the last decade with increasing numbers of observations collected either through citizen science programs or opportunistically by citizens and then submitted into public databases. The expectation of citizens contributing those data is that the data is incorporated into formal analyses and utilised either for scientific or management purposes, with outcomes that improve current understanding and conservation of marine species. Further, there is increasing reliance on more informal and publicly driven approaches to the collection of observations given the costs of conducting formal surveys particularly if accessing remote regions, or if repetition of collection (across seasons or years) is needed.\n\nIntegrating opportunistic observations with more formally collected observations (e.g. those collected through robust survey designs), however, is not straightforward. Traditional approaches to estimating population abundance, changes in species assemblages, abundances and distributions through time require some understanding of the effort associated with those observations and how that effort is also distributed through time; information that is missing from opportunistic observations, given the nature of those observations. Further, many opportunistically collected datasets do not meet the statistical assumptions of many analytical approaches that might be applied to scientific datasets. As a result, opportunistic observations are underutilised at present and are largely only used qualitatively within research applications.\n\nTo take full advantage of this rapidly expanding resource and ensure that efforts associated with the collection of these observations are not wasted, methods that can integrate opportunistically collected data with scientific datasets are needed.\n\nThis project represents the first stage in developing integrative methods. It will bring together data holders, quantitative ecologists and statisticians to explore potential approaches that might be applied to facilitate the integration of opportunistic datasets with scientific datasets. In doing so, it will identify what datasets might be best suited to the development of integrative approaches (and what might not) and outline a pathway for developing those methods that could be implemented through a future project\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Workshop\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\nPart C: Defining a pathway for the operational use of emerging technologies on country.\n\nMarine and coastal impacts in northern Australia occur overwhelmingly on Indigenous managed land. However, the collection, analysis and use of data to support adaptive management of the threats to these important ecosystems is dominated by external organisations. Existing monitoring solutions rely on trust in the training and expertise of the people collecting the data. The appropriate use of technology and associated training for Indigenous practitioners, coupled with software and hardware development, offers an alternative for Indigenous organisations and funders to deliver environmental, social and cultural impacts in northern Australia.\n\nNAILSMA and its partners have been engaged in activities that seek to develop ethical and inclusive technology solutions that enable Indigenous organisations new opportunities to maximize the participation and leadership in activities that support the management of threats to ecosystems across northern Australia.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\nPart D: Barriers to using UAVs in conservation and environmental management.\n\nEnvironmental managers are embracing technology to assist with monitoring and evaluating coastal wetlands. Drones are being used routinely for fauna tracking and water sample collection; however, barriers in broader application still remain for adoption in environmental management. This research will survey conservation professionals about the barriers preventing drone adoption.\n\nTools available for conservation and environmental research are becoming more advanced and accessible to scientists, community and managers (Isosevic et al., 2021). The ability to mobilise science and technology has become increasingly more important for governments that are faced with balancing development and protection of the environment (Cash et al., 2003, Waltham and Sheaves, 2015). With the proliferation of UAV usage in research (Shahbazi et al., 2014, Hardin et al., 2019, Tmušić et al., 2020) and innovative ways in which they can be used to collect data, it is important to investigate whether these have a place in the conservation toolbox for conservation management. Managers need data on ecosystems to manage and protect them (Dale et al., 2019, Di Stefano, 2004), therefore the potential advantages of UAVs means that data collection using these tools could be more representative and cost-effective (Joyce et al., 2019). However, current management structures do not always leverage data or innovations effectively (Cash et al., 2003).\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• manuscript publication\n• summary information sheet",

Mobile predators will be fitted with acoustic transmitters to define their presence and distribution, extent of movement and amount of connectivity between study locations (i.e., movement from bay to inshore reef, movement among reef platforms, etc.).  Predator presence and movement will be integrated with habitat mapping and environmental monitoring data to identify factors that lead to changes in movement patterns and to define any preferred locations or conditions that can be targeted for conservation or management.

This will provide a baseline against which future changes can be assessed and will also enable planning for adaptation to potential sea level rise/increased storm surge. The project builds on Torres Strait Islanders’ knowledge and understanding of mangrove habitats, with scientists working in partnership with Traditional Owners.\n\nThis project will:\n\n1. Undertake a baseline survey of the status and condition of mangroves and freshwater wetland habitats in Torres Strait based on a combination of aerial imagery and on-ground surveys, including documenting species present and identifying the presence of exotic species.\n\n2. Where feasible, document knowledge of selected communities about their uses of mangrove and freshwater habitats and provide management advice for these habitats, where required.\n\n3. Assess mitigation options for mangroves, protection/management/rehabilitation needs, and climate change-related adaptive strategies.",

  "description": "The values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) are threatened by coastal development through habitat loss and runoff of sediment, nutrients and pollutants. Future coastal development is difficult to predict because it depends on volatile socio-economic and political factors. With this in mind, we developed a research project that uses spatially explicit scenario planning to identify plausible futures to 2035 for the GBRWHA coastal zone. The method used to produce maps of these scenarios is land-use change modelling using the GIS Idrisi. A governance analysis for the GBR coast is part of the project and is included in the scenario-planning process. Using a conservation planning approach, this project sets out to identify key priorities for restoring and protecting coastal ecosystems in the GBRWHA coastal zone. The objectives are to:\n- Compile spatial data on the coastal ecosystems and socio-economic characteristics of the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Produce spatially explicit land use scenarios for the GBRWHA coastal zone to 2035\n- Analyse the governance system in the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Identify conservation goals for the GBRWHA coastal zone\n- Assess impacts of development for assets related to the conservation goals\n- Bring all the above information together to determine spatial options for allocating protection and restoration actions to achieve goals",

Along the Queensland coast inshore waters play an important role as nursery areas for sharks. However, the same inshore waters are also most prone to fisheries exploitation and effects of freshwater discharge from coastal streams and rivers. This project will examine the importance of different types of inshore habitat (protected bay vs. open coastline) and marine park zoning (open and closed to fishing), and how environmental factors such as freshwater discharge from rivers effect how these nursery areas function. The project has two broad objectives:\n\nA. Investigate the spatial and temporal changes in the biodiversity and abundance of sharks in inshore nursery areas along the central GBR coast.\nB. Determine the effect of environmental drivers on inshore shark biodiversity along the central GBR coast.\n\nResults from the project will be used to improve the information available to fisheries and marine park managers on the relative importance of inshore habitats, the role of areas closed to fishing, and the sustainability of inshore shark populations.",

  "description": "Pesticides, and particularly herbicides from agricultural sources, have been detected in nearshore sites of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) all year round. The actual impact from these concentrations of herbicides is under debate and information on cumulative impacts is required. To address this, a series of experiments will examine how plants and corals are affected by herbicides in the water in conjunction with other stressors such as temperature, low salinity and low light. An important source of herbicides in coastal waters is flood plumes from river runoff. By creating experimental conditions similar to GBR flood plumes we will determine how long herbicides persist and how they are transformed as they travel into coastal waters.\nThis project will experimentally:\n1. Quantify the chronic effects and toxic thresholds of herbicides detected in the GBR on seagrass and corals under current and future climate scenarios, using controlled laboratory experiments.\n2. Determine the persistence (half lives) of herbicides (including diuron, atrazine, hexazinone and tebuthiuron) at multiple temperatures under light conditions relevant to tropical coastal and inshore waters in flood plumes and test the toxicity of their breakdown products using flask and outdoor tank experiments.",

  "description": "Turbidity is a measure of water clarity that quantifies the amount of small particles suspended in the water, and is a fundamental environmental parameter influencing coastal marine ecosystems. Turbidity reduces the light needed for photosynthesis by corals and seagrasses, and suspended particles also transport nutrients, pollutants and diseases. Previous research based on 3 years of turbidity data collected from 15 inshore reefs by the Reef Rescue Marine Monitoring Program has shown that it can take several months for water clarity to improve after river floods. This project will analyse a 12-year data set to demonstrate the explicit link between variations in discharge (sediments and nutrients) from the major rivers in each Natural Resource Management (NRM) region adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and seasonal and annual variations in water clarity in the inshore GBR.\n\nThis project will:\n\n1. Determine quantitative relationships between river discharges and seasonal and annual variation in inshore water clarity on the GBR adjacent to each NRM region. This is achieved by processing MODIS/Aqua remote sensing (since July 2002) to calculate euphotic depth (water clarity) for the whole GBR and analysing this against  predicted and observed tides, observed waves, wind, rain, river flow data (BOM and DERM daily data) and tidal forcing (Slim model).\n\n2. Strengthen scientific basis for Reef Rescue and Reef Plan and the refinement of water quality targets.\n\n3. Provide data to assist validation and calibration of the Receiving Waters Model and a WQ Risk Analysis.",

  "description": "This project will map the genetic and phylogenetic diversity of northeast Queensland rainforest plants and fungi with a focus on the mountaintop species, which are regarded as among the most at risk from climate warming. The project consists of two nested subprojects. \n\nProject ‘a’ (PD analysis) will provide a broad scale analysis of patterns of genetic diversity across the NE Qld rainforests. This study will investigate the relative performance of taxonomic richness and phylogenetic diversity measures for conservation priority setting in the Wet Tropics and Cape York rainforest contexts. We will use the results to identify and map areas of high biodiversity significance and investigate correlations with environmental and ecological variables. Preliminary results to date show that areas with higher PD than expected contain a higher proportion of immigrant plant lineages dispersed mostly from Southeast Asia within the past few million years. Our results demonstrate how the integration of historical data and PD can more effectively inform conservation priority setting particularly in biomes with complex evolutionary histories. \n\nProject ‘b’ (mountain-top diversity) takes a finer scale look at population-level genetic diversity in one highly restricted rainforest ecosystem – mountain-top rainforest – projected to be most threatened by climate change. We will combine emerging genetic technologies with environmental, ecological and morphological information to: 1) elucidate the location and relative importance of high altitude refugia for plants in the Wet Tropics and Cape York Peninsula Bioregions and the mechanisms that influence the survival of populations and species; and 2) document the fungal biodiversity of the mountain tops.",

  "description": "This project will act as an integrating focus within the rainforest theme to strategically target research gaps and thereby increase our understanding of the drivers of rainforest biodiversity. We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. \n\nThe project consists of four subprojects:\n\nA. Monitoring: Tasks include a microsensor network, standardised vertebrate surveys, habitat structure monitoring and data harvesting from other projects. \n\nA comprehensive review of regional literature followed by extensive stakeholder consultation identified long-term monitoring data as the most important knowledge gap in the region (Welbergen et al. 2011). This sub-project is aimed at maintaining and significantly improving a regional-scale, long-term environmental monitoring program that provides biodiversity and environmental data that has a demonstrated value to a wide range of users including the research community, regional/state/national management agencies and conservation policy development, and national / international bioinformatic infrastructure initiatives (e.g. ALA, TERN). Data collected and maintained here will provide the primary input for the other sub-projects described below with flow-on inputs to many of the other proposed projects across the rainforest node. These data will include but not be limited to:\n1. Regional microclimate sensor network at more than 30 sites established under MTSRF that are strategically placed across elevational and latitudinal gradients in the region.\no Replace and upgrade existing microclimate stations (now defunct/worn out)\no Establish standardised microclimate logging stations in new sites in gaps in environmental coverage, identified climatic refugia, peripheral habitat isolates and increased coverage of the rainforest edge habitats (e.g. wet sclerophyll). Data: temperature (air, soil, microhabitats), humidity, soil moisture, cloud interception.\n2. Standardised vertebrate surveys across all long-term sites (>30) including:\no  2-4 complete surveys per year for three years with 6 replicated sampling points within each site and including standardised surveys of: birds, reptiles, spotlighting (mammals and other nocturnal fauna) and microhylid frogs, with potential to add specific other groups dependent on student projects. \no These surveys follow well-established and extensively published methodologies within the CTBCC (e.g. Williams et al. Ecology 2010).  \n3. Habitat structure monitoring will be continued and improved at all monitoring sites both directly by this project and via site-based collaboration with other projects including rainforest dynamics project (Project 10 - Laurance) and plant genetics (Project 9 -Crayn). \n4. Link to Project 14: potential monitoring of vegetation structure and thermal properties using UAV technology to capture aerial photos, multispectral remote sensing, Lidar vegetation structure, thermal imagery of habitat and fauna, cyclone damage and canopy condition.\n5. Additional monitoring data will be harvested across the node for increased regional and taxonomic coverage and baseline data improvements via links and data exchange with Projects 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 25. \n\n\nB. Climate change vulnerability and adaptation: Includes the production of downscaled regional climate projections, projected changes in species distribution models, composite biodiversity maps, identification and mapping of climate refugia, predictive models of impacts on biodiversity including extreme events. \n\nClimate change is arguably the single largest threat to biodiversity in Australia and the unique biodiversity of the Wet Tropics rainforests is recognised as one of the most threatened ecosystems globally (IPCC 4th AR). This subproject will build on previous and existing research to provide cutting-edge predictions on climate change impacts, vulnerability assessment and adaptation options for rainforest biodiversity. We will link closely with the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Network to ensure that outputs, tools and approaches are distributed across this network for maximum national and regional benefit and outcomes.  Specific objectives and collaborative links include:\n1. Produce and make available downscaled regional climate projections using eight Global Climate Models across multiple (at least 3) emission scenarios at 10 year time steps from 1970-2080 for more than 50 bioclimatic variables;\n2. Projected changes, including uncertainty estimates, in species distribution models and composite biodiversity maps for the majority of rainforest vertebrates, 500+ species of invertebrates, major vegetation types and some key ecosystem processes (baseline data for these analyses were collected under MTSRF and ongoing projects within the CTBCC);\n3. Identify and map climatic refugia (extension of previous MTSRF work that mapped landscape-scale temperature refugia by Shoo et al. 2010a, 2010b). This analysis will expand previous work to include finer scale microhabitat refugia and also increase the generality of the analyses by examining moisture refugia and dry season drought events that have been shown to have significant impacts on biodiversity (Williams & Middleton 2008, Middleton & Williams in review). \n4. Produce predictive impact models on biodiversity that explicitely include a consideration of extreme events rather than just environmental means/averages. Project will link closely with the extreme climate events project (Project 16 – Welbergen) to incorporate the impacts of changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and extent of extreme events, such as heat waves and droughts, as a major component of assessing relative vulnerability and adaptation actions; \n5. Project will closely collaborate with Project 15 (Phillips, Llewelyn) examining the potential for useful local adaptation to climate changeextremes in isolated populations. This link explores the potential to utilise existing adaptive potential as a means to increase species resilience to climate change.\n6. Other external links:\n• NCCARF Refugia project (National) -  proposed\n• NCCARF Terrestrial Biodiversity Research Network\n• Northern Biodiversity NERP Hub\n• AEDA Hub – Restoration project and Future Fellowship (Wintle) examining demographic modelling and climate change.\n7. Incorporate IPCC 5th Assessment Report climate models and scenarios into all above analyses, once they become available.\n\nC. Synthesis, analysis and integration: Determinants of biodiversity: Includes mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and 200+ species of invertebrates, identify key monitoring locations, examining the relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure. \n\nAn understanding of the drivers of biodiversity in the region is crucial to predicting impacts from a variety of threats and ensuring effective conservation planning and management that aims to maintain a resilient landscape. We will use data collected in subproject A in combination with our existing extensive vertebrate and invertebrate database to examine the drivers of biodiversity in the region and to provide the resources and knowledge to make this useful to stakeholders. Specific objectives will include, but not be limited to: \n1. Mapping of almost all rainforest vertebrates and >500 species of invertebrates (distribution and abundance) with emphasis on threatened species;\n2. Identify key locations and taxa where we have long-term count data and/or high frequency of repeat count surveys over time periods that have encompassed important environmental change. We will undertake statistical power analyses to evaluate condition and trends of species (e.g., range shifts, change in population size);\n3. Analyses will also inform the design of our ongoing monitoring program (subproject A) to maximise the detection of change in a cost-effective manner. \n4. Comprehensive habitat/vegetation type vulnerability assessment;\n5. Examine a range of environmental and evolutionary drivers of biodiversity to provide the basic scientific underpinnings for evidence-based policy and management in the region including paleostability of habitat; seasonal habitat and climatic stability, relationships to ecosystem processes such as net primary productivity, habitat structure and heterogeneity, species and habitat compositional turnover and evolutionary biology.\n6. Examine relationships between biodiversity and vegetation and landscape structure (vegetation type and structure, habitat extent, connectivity etc.)\n\nD. Status, trends and future projections: Includes Producing a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets.\n\nNo practical measure currently exists to evaluate trends in biodiversity values at the ‘whole-of-region’ scale in near real-time on a regular, repeatable and affordable basis (WTMA Research Strategy 2010-2014). We will generate high resolution maps and landscape scale estimates of temporal trends in the condition of biodiversity and environmental changes. This will be the major vehicle for synthesizing, integrating and communicating data from all projects. This project will make use of extensive computing power represented by the collaboration between the CTBCC and the James Cook University eResearch group and High Performance Computing Facility. Specific objectives:\n1. Produce and make publicly available a spatial and temporal resources tool that allows web-based query of all the above datasets based on a user-defined spatial area that will return all predicted and observed data within the query area for climate (past, current and future projections), habitat, species (predicted and observed), biodiversity values, terrain, ecosystem processes and, where available data is site-based, the tool could query the temporal patterns in the data (e.g. changes in abundance of a species) with “approaching real-time” updates (expected bi-annual upload of all new biodiversity and environmental data with temporal resolution dependent on the specific data stream, example quarterly for the standardised vertebrate surveys).\n2. Automatic upload, synthesis and visualisation in JCU eResearch group (Tropical Data Hub) including time series examination of trends;\n3. Automated upload via Tropical Data Hub onto National (ALA, TERN, NPEI) and international (GBIF) data infrastructure. This means that as data is entered into our system from the monitoring program and other projects, it will be uploaded and available via national and international data portals;\n4. Future forecasting of trends and forecasts via combination of modelling and workshopping to conduct future horizon scanning.\n\nOnce established, these bioinformatic tools could form the basis for UNESCO, and Queensland and Australian government reporting on the state of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and could easily be utilized more generally across other ecosystems in Australia.",

  "description": "The project will determine the status of threatened marine (green, hawksbill and flatback) turtles and dugongs in the Torres Strait and threats to these populations. It also will investigate links between different populations of dugongs and turtles in terms of movement and habitat use. They will also assess the abundance of dugongs in the Torres Strait using aerial surveys.\n\nWorking in conjunction with the Torres Strait Regional Authorities (TSRA) Land and Sea Unit and the TSRA Community Ranger program this project will:\n\n1. Determine the status of green turtles in Torres Strait (sex ratios, patterns of juvenile recruitment, nesting success and hatchling production) using seasonal surveys of green turtle foraging and nesting sites. Foraging sites will vary to cover as many different habitats as possible (e.g. one per year). Nesting sites will include Maizub Kaur (Bramble Cay) and Dowar Island (Mer Group)\n\n2. Determine the status of hawksbill and flatback turtles in Torres Strait by conducting Iama community and Mabuiag Community seasonal surveys and trial remote camera deployments at Sassie Island and Malu Kiai (Deliverance Island) to quantify nesting events, which are suspected to be declining, and predation levels, which are speculated to be high. Data will then be used in combination with survey data collected by QDERM (Col Limpus) since 1992, and other life history and mortality data to determine a robust account of population status.\n\n3. Investigate population connectivity of dugong and green turtles using satelite tracking of dugongs caught in the northern section of Torres Strait (i.e. around Biogu), analysis of previous tracking data (from QDERM, CRC TS, MTSRF and AMMC) of turtles and dugongs and collection of skin samples from dugongs and green turtles to strengthen the genetic understanding.\n\n4. Undertake dugong and turtle aerial surveys in March 2011 and November 2013 of western Torres Strait, including the Dugong Sanctuary and the area west of Orman Reef in association with a parallel survey of the northern GBR. \n\n5. Analyse historical data to examine patterns of turtle abundance in key areas such as western Torres Strait and the Dugong Sanctuary.",

  "description": "The Wet Tropics World Heritage Area (WTWHA) is famous for its wildlife, biodiversity and natural beauty, but none of these important assets are bought or sold in the market place, so none are explicitly ‘valued’ with a price.  Recognising that absence of price does not mean absence of value, this project seeks to improve our understanding of the importance of these non-market ‘values’ to a variety of different stakeholders. How important is a beautiful view or a cassowary to the community, to tourists and to the tourism industry? How would people feel if there fewer (or more) opportunities to enjoy those beautiful views or to observe these charismatic birds?\n\nThe project will provide environmental managers throughout the world with an illustrated, easy to understand, means of assessing the importance of these types of non-market values to a variety of different stakeholder groups in World Heritage listed forests and other scenic environments. \n\nThis project will:\n1. Develop a survey to assess the relative importance of core 'values' of the WTWHA (e.g. cassowaries, mahogany sugar gliders, waterfalls, aesthetics) with other ‘values’ (e.g. development of roads, employment, or income) so that managers are able to assess trade-offs between core WTWHA attributes and other ‘values’.\n\n2. Distribute the questionaire to residents (householders) throughout the WTWHA and to tourists at the Cairns airport at different times of the year (to control for seasonality of data) in the form of an exit survey;\n\n3. To analyse the results using multivariate analysis to measure the satisfaction and relative value across different stakeholder groups and to use insights from this analysis to identify priorities for conservation and marketing.",

  "description": "The project will assist decision-makers to more efficiently restore biodiversity to degraded rainforest landscapes by providing new knowledge about the outcomes of lower-cost natural regeneration (including potential for minimum intervention management) relative to higher-cost active reforestation (replanting) on post-agricultural land. The outcomes of this project will enable planners to assess the costs, risks and benefits of different approaches to reforestation and choose the most appropriate method for any particular ecological and economic context.\n\nThis project will:\n1. Quantify the rate and pattern of development of vegetation during rainforest regrowth following cessation of agricultural use, and how this compares with the outcomes of publicly-funded restoration by tree-planting.\n2. Investigate, trial and promote emerging technologies for the acceleration and redirection of rainforest regrowth, to overcome ecological barriers or thresholds that inhibit rainforest redevelopment.\n3. Identify locations and situations where passive restoration (unassisted regrowth) is a preferable alternative to high-cost active restoration (replanting).\n\nThis will help government agencies and landholders to better forecast outcomes resulting from passive regeneration over defined time frames. This knowledge will also be useful to private enterprises interested in capitalising on emerging carbon markets.\n\nThis work will be done on the Atherton Tablelands in the Wet Tropics.",

  "description": "Short duration rainfall extremes, often tied to intense storms and flash flooding, have a significant impact on urban infrastructure and the environment. We are doing research to improve our knowledge of past trends in these extremes and how they will change in the future due to climate change. This work will contribute to updating infrastructure guidelines and will improve resilience in urban areas.  \n\nChanging short-duration extreme rainfall in Australian cities \nIn many Australian cities, short duration (hourly and shorter) extreme rainfall events have become more frequent and intense, posing an increasing risk to communities. We aim to improve understanding of these changing extremes and how future climate change will further exacerbate the risk of flash floods. Through a detailed analysis of meteorological station data, weather radar observations, and high-resolution regional climate model simulations, this research will inform future infrastructure planning and design. It will also directly contribute to updating the Australian Rainfall and Runoff Guidelines, ensuring that Australia’s drainage infrastructure can effectively cope with the intensifying rainfall extremes. \n\nEnhancing resilience through better data and updated infrastructure guidelines \nThis project will address key knowledge gaps related to short duration rainfall extremes in Australian cities, focusing on both historical trends and future projections under various climate change scenarios. By analysing these trends, the project will offer insights into how extreme rainfall events will evolve, helping to assess the increasing risks to urban environments. It will also evaluate regional climate models, including the Weather Research and Forecasting model, to assess their accuracy in simulating short duration rainfall extremes. This will identify strengths and limitations, improving the ability to predict future events.  \n\nUltimately, the project will contribute to better adaptation strategies, helping Australian cities build resilience to climate change and extreme rainfall events. This project is co-leading, with ACS, the CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study (FPS) Sub-Hourly Extreme Precipitation (SHEP) and is a collaboration with multiple research groups nationally and internationally.",

  "description": "When extreme rainfall combines with other hazards, such as strong winds, the impacts can be devastating. This project helps identify and map these high-impact events to support better planning and resilience. \n\nUnderstanding extreme rainfall and its impacts \nExtreme rainfall can have greater impacts when it is part of a compound event. When multiple heavy rainfall events occur in quick succession, river levels are higher; when extreme rainfall follows drought, it can be accompanied by debris flows, landslides and water quality impacts. And when extreme rain co-occurs with extreme wind, the risk of water ingress, treefalls and power interruptions are increased. Working with stakeholders, this project will build better indices of impactful compound extreme rainfall, to help understand when, where, and how they occur.\n\nThis project will work with stakeholders to identify the most critical extreme rainfall events and develop new ways to measure and analyse them. By focusing on real-world case studies, researchers will gain insights into the factors that make these events particularly damaging, such as their frequency, duration, and interactions with other hazards. \n\nDelivering tools for better risk assessment \nThrough case studies, the project will create innovative methods to define and map hazardous rainfall events, such as drought-breaking rains, clusters of extreme rainfall, and extreme wet/windy conditions. These new approaches will help decision makers better understand how these events are changing and where they are most likely to occur in the future. The project will also provide indices to assess high-impact rainfall hazards, improving climate risk assessments and emergency planning. Stakeholders, including state government agencies and private industry bodies, will be involved in co-designing the research, ensuring that the findings directly support decision making and preparedness efforts.",

  "description": "We have identified that regional and remote local governments could be, and in some cases, are, playing a pivotal role, working closely with state and federal programs and industry from the ‘top down’ while also serving local community and business. This means they can play a role as ‘transition brokers’, working across different levels of government, industry and community.  Recognising this, the overarching theory of change for this initiative is that by collaborating with local governments, the Australian Circular Economy Hub (ACE Hub) and relevant state and federal agencies, we can develop a model for networked CE governance best suited to supporting regional CE in Australia",

  "description": "This project is a three-year investment to develop guiding principles and frameworks to help governments, civil society and communities undertake best practices in adaptation. It supports the NESP Climate Adaptation Initiative to answer important questions about how Australia is adapting to climate change. \nIn a changing climate, adaptation is crucial for the well-being and prosperity of all Australians. Supported by solid decision-making frameworks, successful adaptation is built from the best available science and evidence.\nGovernments and organisations are increasingly considering future climate risks as part of the adaptation planning and implementation processes. To guide best practice and form a national picture of what works well, there is much to learn from plans and action already in progress.\nThis project has explored ‘enablers’ of adaptation to understand how adaptation practitioners can help overcome barriers they face. It has also developed guiding principles on what best practice adaptation looks like. \nIn 2025 we released the Australian Adaptation Database, Australia’s first national climate change adaptation stocktake. The Australian Adaptation Database is helping to understand Australia’s progress toward climate change adaptation, collecting and categorising a sample of adaptation activities happening across different scales, sectors and geographic locations.

  "description": "Currently, building energy efficiency software uses historical climate data to assess performance. By exploring new approaches to incorporate future weather and heat extremes into building energy efficiency modelling, this project is helping to guide the development of more energy-efficient, climate-resilient buildings.  \n\nCo-designing new approaches to incorporate future climate projections into building energy efficiency modelling \nWe must consider our changing climate when designing buildings with an expected lifespan of approximately 50-70 years, to ensure occupants are comfortable and healthy, especially during extremes such as heatwaves. By combining the expertise of climate scientists and industry practitioners, we will develop a new methodology and test it with case studies and real-world applications of prototype future average and extreme weather files across Australia.   \n\nShaping the design of energy-efficient buildings for the 2070s and beyond \nThrough co-design with policy and industry experts, this project aims to contribute to improved policy outcomes for NatHERS (Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme) and NABERS (National Australian Built Environment Rating Scheme), as well as influencing the 2028 update to the National Construction Code for residential buildings. We will pilot the new methodology with case studies and real-world applications of the new climate files with industry practitioners across Australia. By co-developing fit-for-purpose future average and extreme weather files, we are progressing towards Australian buildings being built to efficiently cope with more frequent and intense heatwaves.",

  "description": "Coastal water quality is threatened by an increasing volume of chemicals produced and used in our modern lives. These chemicals are commonly incorporated into pharmaceuticals and household items, and subsequently discharged into coastal areas from a broad range of point sources. Recently emerging contaminants include a variety of chemical (e.g. heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, nutrients) and microbiological (e.g. pathogens, antibiotic resistant microbes) sources that are discharged in sewage, stormwater, estuarine flows and industrial wastes.\n\nFor many of these chemicals, our understanding of their environmental concentrations and biological effects is limited. When new scientific information emerges to suggest that a particular contaminant may be hazardous, this is refered to as a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC). There is limited data about the environmental occurrence and biological effects of CECs, but emerging research suggests they have the capacity to be toxic.\n\nWith an increasing list of CECs detected in the environment, important questions remain unanswered around which contaminants and scientific knowledge gaps should be prioritised. This desktop study engaged CEC stakeholders from academic research, government, water utilities, and non-government organisations to collaboratively identify priority CEC issues in Australia’s marine ecosystems. The project delivers a risk-based framework for future CEC research directions and water quality management priorities.",

  "description": "Standardised approaches to marine monitoring are critical for ensuring data consistency, transparency, and comparability across time, regions, and sectors. The development and application of national standards and best practices provide the foundation for monitoring the condition of Australia’s marine estate. As pressures on the marine environment increase, so too does the need for robust, inclusive, and nationally consistent monitoring practices.\n\nThis project advanced the development and implementation of national best-practice standards to monitor the condition of priority values and pressures across Australia's marine estate. It built on previous work conducted by the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub through the release of Version 3 of the [*Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters*](https://marine-sampling-field-manual.github.io/). This version introduced three new manuals for: (1) sampling microplastics in marine and coastal environments; (2) conducting knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys with recreational marine users; and (3) use of the Benthic Observation Survey System (BOSS), a novel multi-camera drop platform for benthic imagery. Indigenous partners contributed to the development of the KAP and BOSS manuals, laying the foundation for future Indigenous-led monitoring initiatives.\n\nThe project identified key barriers to adoption of the field manuals and developed a set of recommendations, included nominating the manuals for international endorsement, establishing governance mechanisms, securing long-term funding, and identifying priorities for future SOP development, such as offshore renewable energy monitoring. All materials were aligned with the Ocean Best Practices System to facilitate national and international uptake.\n\nA practical implementation plan was developed to guide the future development and maintenance of national standards; promote their broader adoption; and assess their effectiveness and impact in delivering priority monitoring activities.",

  "description": "The system of marine parks that spans Australia’s Commonwealth waters is among the largest in the world. These parks play a major role in conserving marine life, supporting commercial and recreational activities, and protecting cultural values significant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Parks Australia has developed management plans for five regional Australian Marine Park (AMP) networks (North, North-west, South-west, South-east and Temperate East) and the Coral Sea Marine Park (CSMP). Under each management plan, a science plan sets priorities for monitoring and research to evaluate management effectiveness and identify opportunities for improvement. This prioritisation is vital given the limited knowledge across many AMPs, the technical challenges and high costs of science in remote areas, and the finite resources available for park management.\n\nBuilding on foundational work from the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub (projects [SS2](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-ss2-%E2%80%93-interpreting-pressure-profiles.html) and [D7](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-d7-%e2%80%93-supporting-monitoring-evaluation-reporting-and-improvement-system-australian.html)), this project delivered the scientific and technical advice needed to establish monitoring priorities for natural values and pressures across all AMP networks and the CSMP—completing a full national priority list for monitoring. It applied a nationally consistent four-step prioritisation framework that considered ecological importance, vulnerability to pressures, baseline data availability, and logistical feasibility. The project also updated the National Ecosystem model and Pressures & Activities datasets, conducted expert vulnerability assessments, and produced a Relative Cumulative Impact index. The combined research delivers a nationally accepted \"common language\" to describe natural values and pressures and a science-based method to derive monitoring priorities, aligned with the Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement (MERI) system—an adaptive management framework that is globally unique and a significant step towards adaptive, integrated, place-based management.\n\nKey outputs include a national database of environmental and human-use data for each management region and a refined list of monitoring priorities for each AMP Network and the CSMP. The findings highlight major knowledge gaps—particularly in the distribution of mesophotic and rariphotic reefs, intertidal ecosystems, and recreational fishing impacts—and provide guidance for improving baseline data and pressure assessments. The prioritisation framework and data products developed through this project can be re-generated over time alongside improvements in the evidence base and our understanding of how ecosystems respond to multi-sectoral activities to support continual improvement in iterative, evidence-based park management and environmental outcomes.",

  "description": "Rocky reefs on Australia's temperate continental shelf support diverse ecological communities, including corals, sponges, mobile invertebrates, fish, and marine mammals. These habitats underpin important natural, economic, and cultural values and are subject to pressures from fishing, shipping, and climate change. Rocky reefs are key features of many Australian Marine Parks (AMPs), and improving knowledge of their extent and condition is essential for effective management and evaluation of conservation outcomes - particularly in offshore areas where seafloor habitat data is limited.\n\nThis project addressed knowledge gaps on the extent and distribution of seabed habitats by focusing on rocky reef systems within the South-west and South-east Marine Parks Networks. It built on previous research from the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub by collating and analysing existing seafloor data, and deploying drop cameras at priority sites (selected in consultation with Parks Australia and other end-users) to validate seafloor habitat extent and type. This new survey data was incorporated with newly developed data workflows to generate ecosystem models of reef and soft sediments, and broad-scale ecosystem classes - with a focus on workflows enabling rapid update of products and ensuring consistency across mapping outputs. These data products directly support NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project 2.3 ([Improving knowledge transfer for AMP management](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/2-3/)).\n\nThe project team worked with Indigenous Rangers and organisations in the South-west region to identify opportunities for collaboration, incorporate cultural knowledge into research design, and support knowledge exchange through field-based activities and on-country engagement. The project aimed to strengthen both established and emerging relationships, building on existing collaborations between University of Western Australia (UWA) researchers and the Esperance Tjaltjraak Native Title Aboriginal Corporation (ETNTAC) on complementary projects. UWA had also previously partnered with the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council (SWALSC), in consultation with the South West Boojarah (now Karri Karrak) and the Undalup Association, to support cultural mapping and biodiversity surveys under the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub. These partnerships informed the project’s cultural engagement approach and laid the groundwork for ongoing collaboration.\n\nOutcomes of this work included improved capacity for AMP managers to identify and monitor rocky reef habitats and key natural values, assess management effectiveness, and support initiatives such as marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based fisheries management, and contribute to emerging frameworks such as ocean accounting. It also helped to guide the targeting of future surveys, particularly in ecosystems with high conservation value.",

  "description": "The southern right whale (*Eubalaena australis*) is listed as Endangered under the *Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999* (EPBC Act) and is subject to conservation listings in five Australian states due to severe population declines caused by historical whaling. The Southern Right Whale Conservation Management Plan 2011–2021 outlines the current status of, and threats to, the southern right whale in Australian waters and prioritises recovery actions during this period. The long-term vision for the recovery of this species in Australian waters is to increase the population size to a level that the conservation status improves, and the species no longer qualifies for listing as threatened under any of the EPBC Act listing criteria. The plan must be periodically updated to reflect new knowledge and prioritise the research needed to monitor population recovery and predict the impacts of threats such as climate change.\n\nAerial surveys of southern right whales have been conducted across the southern Australian coast from Perth (WA) to Ceduna (SA) since 1993, as part of a long-term program to monitor the recovery, and inform the Conservation Management Plan (2011-2021), for this Endangered species. In Australia’s south-east, there has been little sign of recovery in southern right whale numbers following intense commercial whaling. A working hypothesis assumes separation between the ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ populations, largely due to loss of ‘cultural memory’ of whales migrating to the eastern range breeding areas. Given the relative paucity of animals that visit the southern Australian coast in areas other than south-west Australia, the western population is considered to represent the majority of the ‘Australian’ southern right whale population. The count data from these aerial surveys provide data on population trend and estimates of population size for the ‘western’ population, and hence the majority of the Australian southern right whales. Associated photo-identification data provide life history information (such as calving intervals) and connectivity between the ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ populations and contribute to the national southern right whale photo-id database: the Australasian Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalogue (ARWPIC).\n\nThe 2020 aerial survey program recorded substantially lower numbers of whales than in the previous 13 years, and the lowest number of non-calving whales since the program started. This project conducted new aerial surveying in August 2021 to provide a relative estimate of annual population size for determining longer term population trends and contribute to determining if 2020 was an anomalous year or an indicator of some longer-term change to recent recovery rates and the female breeding cycle.",

  "description": "Recreational fishing is an important leisure activity in Australia that delivers important social and economic benefits to the community. As the largest and most widely dispersed natural resource-based recreational activity in the country, it is subject to management strategies including bag limits, quotas, and no-take zones. Given the prohibitive cost of deploying compliance officers to monitor Australia’s vast marine estate, strategies are needed to encourage voluntary compliance from fishers.\n\nThis project explored behavioural interventions to promote self-compliance among recreational fishers, focusing on no-take zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and two Commonwealth parks off Western Australia (Geographe and Two Rocks). The research distributed more than 800 online surveys, followed up by focus groups and analysis to examine how demographics, motivations and fishing patterns influence fishers' intentions to comply with zoning rules.\n\nSurvey insights were used to pilot a new targeted approach to awareness campaigns. Using behavioural segmentation, the project tailored messaging to specific audience types and tested these via GBRMPA social media channels. The project also examined perceptions of compliance visibility and found fishers were more likely to comply when uniformed officers were present and engaged directly at ramps or on water.\n\nThe project outcomes provide a foundation for evidence-based behavioural interventions and targeted communication campaigns. It delivers a proof of concept for scalable, audience-specific behaviour change approaches that can be refined, implemented, and evaluated in future research.",

  "description": "Plastic pollution is pervasive in coastal environments globally and in Australia. Due to their small size, microplastics (pieces <5mm) are readily ingested by marine organisms and potentially accumulate across food webs, raising concerns for biota, ecosystem services and human health. Yet, to define guidelines and support policy actions that curb microplastic pollution, managers and decision-makers lack clear, synthesised information on this multifaceted issue, including on occurrence, sources, and pathways of microplastics in coastal and marine environments.\n\nThis project synthesised current knowledge on microplastics in the coastal waters of South-Eastern Australia (South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales), identifying key gaps in data, monitoring, and risk assessment. A central output was a compiled database of existing microplastics studies across the study region. Through engagement with stakeholders from government, research, and industry, the project defined shared priorities and barriers to action. Three critical research needs were identified: (1) methodological harmonisation, (2) source and pathway identification, and (3) evidence of ecological risk. Together, the synthesis and stakeholder input set a clear direction for future coordinated research to enable evidence-based management of microplastic pollution across jurisdictions.\n\nThe work laid the foundation for the development of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for marine microplastics sampling, which was subsequently delivered through [NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project 2.2 ](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/2-2): chapter [*Marine sampling field manual for microplastics*](https://microplastics-field-manual.github.io) in [*Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters, Version 3*](https://marine-sampling-field-manual.github.io).",

As the population increases, the whales extend their breeding areas into previously occupied suitable habitat. As the species recovers, there is increasing evidence of expansion of aggregation areas. Consequently, there is a need to update known established aggregation areas and Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) and update relevant Marine Parks management plans based on new evidence.\n\nFlinders Bay and Geographe Bay off south-western Western Australia were likely to have been important calving areas before commercial whaling began. Much of this habitat is popular for recreational boating and other marine activities. This project collated and completed photo-ID matching of southern right whale images collected between 2010 to 2020 in the southwest of Australia, and uploaded these to the Australasian Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalogue (ARWPIC). The photo-ID matching outcomes provide evidence that Flinders Bay and Geographe Bay now fit the criteria to be recognised nationally as Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for Southern Right Whales.",

  "description": "Marine and coastal wetlands provide extensive ecosystem services—protecting shorelines, improving water quality, supporting healthy fisheries, promoting tourism, storing carbon, and holding cultural significance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Like many wetlands around the world, Australian wetlands continue to be threatened, degraded, and lost due to climate change, development, and other human activities.\n\nTo support the Australian Government’s development of a national wetland inventory, this project assessed the current state of coastal wetland mapping across five key areas: seagrass, saltmarsh, intertidal macroalgae, shorebird habitat, and blue carbon. It identified major knowledge and inventory gaps through a combination of literature review and consultation with 73 end-users and experts, resulting in 25 targeted recommendations to guide future mapping and data integration.\n\nA summary of the status of mapping habitat attributes and ecosystem services such as blue carbon, coastal protection and shorebird habitat is available in the project's Final Technical Report. This report incudes recommendations to guide investment in high-demand areas and support nationally consistent wetland management and reporting to address key knowledge gaps.",

  "description": "Effective management of natural resources and biodiversity requires an integrated understanding of the complex relationships between people and nature. This project reviewed a range of socio-ecological frameworks to identify which system components influence environmental outcomes, and which are most relevant for policy design and behaviour change. A key point of difference from previous NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub projects was an additional theme on implementation pathways, enabling research to inform the full progression from policy to on-ground action.\n\nThrough a co-design process with stakeholders, the project identified priority social and economic research needs and assessed the availability of relevant datasets to meet them. A key outcome was the identification of three common decision contexts faced by managers—monitoring, trade-off analysis, and promoting behaviour change—and the matching of appropriate frameworks and data to each context. The findings highlight critical data gaps, while providing practical guidance on how existing information can be strategically used to inform management and policy decisions.",

  "description": "Seagrasses provide resources and ecosystem services critical to the health of coastal ecosystems and human populations. They increase water clarity, stabilise sediments and reduce coastal erosion, sequester carbon, and provide habitat and food to marine animals, including commercially important fish and invertebrates. Across Australia, the loss of >275,000 ha of seagrass meadows and associated ecosystem services—valued at AU$ 5.3 billion—has contributed to the long-term degradation of estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. Restoration of seagrass is critical for improving the health and function of these ecosystems and sustaining coastal communities and industries that depend on them, yet restoration projects to date typically occur at small scales, driven by local priorities and with variable success.\n\nThis project addressed this problem by bringing together scientists and key stakeholders to collate knowledge on seagrass ecology and restoration, and generated a framework to scaling-up restoration nationally. A national workshop with experts identified a shortlist of drivers key to restoration success, including sediment dynamics, microbial communities, hydrodynamics, and species interactions. It highlighted the importance of incorporating seagrass genetics and life histories into site and donor material selection to improve long-term resilience. New technologies such as eDNA, automation, and AI were also assessed for their potential to improve monitoring and reduce costs, while standardised methodologies and molecular tools were recommended to track microbial indicators and site suitability. A key insight from the workshop was the central role of sediment processes in feedback loops that determine seagrass health—providing a foundation for more effective, scalable restoration strategies.\n\nOn-ground case studies were conducted in Western Australia and New South Wales to test the proposed restoration framework in collaboration with Indigenous and community partners: sediment quality assessment and manipulation (Gamay Rangers, UNSW); seed and seedling capture using sediment-filled hessian tubes (Malgana Rangers, UWA); and large-scale seed collection for seed-based restoration through the 'Seeds for Snapper' initiative (OzFish and UWA). These trials demonstrated the effectiveness of community-led restoration and reinforced the potential of seed-based methods for scaling up seagrass recovery.",

  "description": "Coastal and marine environments are increasingly exposed to pollution from land-based sources, including wastewater. With the majority of Australians living near the coast, household chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and plastics can enter the ocean via wastewater treatment plant outfalls. National policies and action plans, including Australia’s Waste Policy Action Plan, the Threat Abatement Plan for the impacts of marine debris, and the One Health Master Action Plan, all emphasise the need to incorporate emerging pollutants into contaminant guidelines. However, current monitoring programs focus on a limited set of contaminants, leaving major gaps in our understanding of the presence, concentration, and ecological effects of emerging pollutants in the marine environment.\n\nThis project addressed this problem by: (1) identifying priority pollutants of concern; (2) determining concentrations of Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CEC) at a range of wastewater outfall sites with varying hydrodynamic settings; and (3) assessing where environmental impacts are likely to be greatest. It focused on five key pollutant groups: microplastics, nutrients, heavy metals, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), and antimicrobials. Hydrodynamic modelling was used to evaluate residence times and pollutant dispersal in selected marine settings, and field sampling was conducted to assess contaminant levels and potential ecological impacts on the lower food web. The project built on the findings of NESP MaC [Scoping Study 1.16](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/1-16/), which identified the need for impact assessments for CECs.\n\nThe project generated new knowledge to inform risk assessments of emerging contaminants in the marine environment and provides recommendations for prioritising future monitoring and investment. It also enhances access to wastewater discharge data through continued development of the [National Outfall Database](https://nod.org.au/).",

  "description": "The Great Southern Reef (GSR) is an 8,000 km network of temperate rocky reefs stretching from Western Australia to New South Wales. Dominated by kelp forests, it is one of the world’s most biodiverse and productive marine ecosystems, supporting important fisheries, tourism, cultural values, and ecological functions. Despite its significance, kelp forests are in decline due to ocean warming, marine heatwaves, pollution, and expanding herbivore populations—threatening both biodiversity and the services these reefs provide. Evidence-based management is hindered without accurate estimates of the GSR's contribution to society and the economy.\n\nThis project delivered the first systematic synthesis of existing data on the ecosystem services and economic value of the GSR, focusing on shallow reefs (0–50 m). Market and non-market services—such as commercial and recreational fishing, tourism, carbon sequestration, and existence value—were assessed for each state in which the GSR occurs. The synthesis highlighted the high societal dependence on the GSR, with over 17 million Australians living within 50 km of its waters and significant national engagement in related economic and cultural activities.\n\nAll data inventoried by the project were aligned with national and international environmental-economic accounting standards to support future inclusion in Australia’s ocean accounting frameworks. This inventory provides the foundation for developing a national ocean account for kelp forests, and identifies the key data gaps that must be addressed to fully capture the GSR’s value and guide long-term policy and investment.",

  "description": "Australia’s coastal floodplains and wetlands provide essential ecosystem services and have immense cultural value. They regulate water quality, moderate flood and storm damage, and provide habitat for marine life including commercial fish and shellfish species. These environments are threatened by accelerating rates of sea-level rise. A national approach is needed to monitor and assess the way coastal floodplains and wetlands are changing in response to sea level rise.\n\nA useful measure of resilience is the extent to which coastal wetland sediments can accrete vertically at a rate matching that of sea-level rise. Assessing the resilience, or vulnerability, of these environments requires measurements of rates of vertical accretion, subsidence and elevation gain across a range of coastal settings. The Surface Elevation Table-Marker Horizon (SET-MH) technique measures the vertical accretion of coastal wetland sediments. This enables assessment of whether wetlands are keeping pace with sea level rise (measured at tide gauges), or subsiding relative to local sea level rise and thus vulnerable to permanent inundation and loss.\n\nAustralia’s network of Surface Elevation Tables is one of the most extensive in the world, consisting of over 200 benchmark monitoring stations from Westernport Bay, Victoria to Darwin Harbour, NT. The network has developed largely without national coordination, and the data gathered have not been readily available to the research community or research users.\n\nThis project collated SET data on accretion, subsidence and elevation change in mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses and tidal freshwater forests, and provides an initial analysis of accretion and surface elevation trends. This information is vital to coastal risk assessment, estimating blue carbon sequestration, and modelling potential predicted changes in other ecosystem services.",

  "description": "Spotted Handfish (*Brachionichthys hirsutus*) were once common across the bays and estuaries of South-eastern Tasmania. By 1996, however, populations had declined and the species was listed as Critically Endangered under Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The species is relatively short-lived, (5–10 years) and matures at more than two years’ old. This leaves a short window for reproduction, which relies on egg masses laid on seafloor structures such as stalked ascidians. If spawning fails, population declines may occur rapidly. With no planktonic life stage to aid dispersal, and low adult dispersal, outside recruitment to re-establish collapsed populations is unlikely.\n\nAnalysis of 23 years of Spotted Handfish survey data (1997–2019) supported by previous NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub work [Project A10](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-a10-conservation-handfish-and-their-habitat.html) helped develop a time-series of survey data, increasing biological understanding and contributing to effective management actions. This project recommenced surveys of multiple local populations, after a two-year gap, to ensure that the potential impacts of development of the Derwent estuary and surrounds handfish populations or their habitats can be detected. Included in the population surveying was identification of suitable locations to plant Artificial Spawning Habitats (ASH) where natural spawning structures have declined. This will continue to support the species' captive breeding program with industry and foster engagement with the indigenous and broader community through participation, talks, outreach, publications, and the National Handfish Recovery Team (NHRT).",

  "description": "The Maugean skate (*Zearaja maugeana*) is listed as Endangered under Tasmania’s *Threatened Species Protection Act and the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999*. Its known population is small (~3,000 individuals, Macquarie Harbour, 2016) and highly restricted, having only been recorded in two isolated estuaries: Bathurst Harbour and Macquarie Harbour in south-western/western Tasmania. This constitutes one of the most limited distributions of any known extant elasmobranch.\n\nAlthough the skate was first discovered in Bathurst Harbour, most knowledge of the species stems from the Macquarie Harbour population. Only four individuals have been reported in Bathurst Harbour, with the last reported sighting in 1992. Environmental conditions in Macquarie Harbour have changed markedly since then due to anthropogenic activities in and around the estuary including historical mining, hydro-electric generation and alteration of natural river flows, and marine fish farming.\n\nPrevious research has shown clear signs of population stress and evidence of detrimental impacts of degraded environmental conditions on the Maugean Skate in Macquarie Harbour. Understanding the potential population status of the Maugean Skate in Bathurst Harbour will assist in determining conservation actions. This study used Environmental (e) DNA to determine the presence/absence of Maugean skate in Bathurst Harbour, strengthening the evidence base for effective conservation plans and specific recovery actions.",

  "description": "Southern right whales are listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act and are a species of national conservation significance. Monitoring of their recovery is guided by the *Southern Right Whale Conservation Management Plan*, which aims to improve the population’s conservation status through regular assessment of population size, calving intervals, and spatial trends.\n\nThis project continued the long-term aerial survey program of southern right whales along the southern Australian coast, spanning from Perth (WA) to Ceduna (SA). Annual surveys have been conducted since 1993, providing a continuous long-term dataset for the 'western' population and supporting national assessments of connectivity with the smaller ‘eastern’ population. The surveys contribute essential data on population trends, calving rates, and movements of individuals.\n\nThe August 2022 aerial survey ensured an uninterrupted time series in the long-term population trend data. This is particularly important given the species' non-annual breeding cycle (typically every three years). Annual surveys are essential to maintain an acceptable level of precision in estimating population trends and key life history parameters. A total of 526 whales were recorded, including 247 cow–calf pairs, 31 unaccompanied adults and one yearling. Based on long-term models, this equated to a population estimate of approximately 2,675 individuals, with an average annual growth rate of ~5.3%.\n\nWhile this represents a continued population growth, results suggest a possible slowing in the rate of growth over the past 13 years (from 7.5% in 2009). The 2022 survey also recorded the lowest number of unaccompanied animals in the entire time series, extending a five-year trend of low sightings in this group. Continued monitoring of the population is needed to assess whether these changes represent longer-term shifts in population dynamics and calving intervals, and to inform adaptive management for this long-lived, slow-recovering species.",

  "description": "Coastal Australia is home to 37 regularly occurring migratory shorebird species, with many protected areas including Ramsar sites designated on the basis of shorebird populations. Many migratory shorebirds are declining rapidly, and hence the focus of conservation efforts at multiple levels of government in Australia and overseas. However, trend data are now nearly 10 years old, meaning the information available to assess where conservation actions are needed most urgently and whether conservation efforts are helping species recover are outdated.\n\nTo ensure populations have the best chance at recovery and that resources are allocated where they are most likely to have the greatest positive impacts, it is critical to maintain up-to-date information on species trends. This project analysed 30 years of shorebird monitoring data collected by citizen science groups across Australia and curated by BirdLife Australia’s National Shorebird Monitoring Program to update national trend estimates, while also assessing the relative effects of human pressure and conservation efforts on population trends. In particular, it focused on 15 migratory shorebird species whose conservation status was being reassessed by the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This project sets the stage for building the next decade of coastal shorebird conservation activity in Australia, coordinated through the national mechanism of the End User: National Migratory Shorebird Conservation Action Plan Steering Committee, with representatives from national and state governments as well as leading shorebird experts.",

  "description": "Coastal habitat restoration is scaling up rapidly in Australia and covers a range of diverse ecosystems including oyster reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, kelp forests, and saltmarshes. While monitoring is commonly included in these projects, approaches are often uncoordinated, inconsistently funded, and rarely follow open science protocols.\n\nPrevious NESP-funded projects have advanced understanding of the ecology and service provision of threatened ecosystems and established targets for repair based on reference conditions (e.g. Marine Biodiversity Hub [Project B4](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-b4-underpinning-repair-and-conservation-australias-threatened-coastal-marine.html)). They also created a national database of marine and coastal restoration projects (Australian Coastal Restoration Network: [Project E5](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-e5-role-restoration-conserving-matters-national-environmental-significance.html)) and supported the development of monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement (MERI) systems across various sectors. Building on this foundation, the current project synthesised monitoring approaches across multiple habitat types by drawing on the collective expertise of Australian researchers. It also explored the integration of emerging technologies—such as automation, artificial intelligence, and eDNA—to improve monitoring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe primary output of this project is a coordinated, open-science monitoring framework that incorporates clearly defined restoration goals and a core set of universal variables. Developed through expert consultation, the framework supports consistent benchmarking across projects while accommodating habitat-specific and goal-driven metrics. The framework promotes data accessibility, standardised definitions, and the integration of new technologies to streamline the development of future restoration projects and maximise the value of restoration monitoring.",

They developed and tested standardised survey techniques to allows scientists and park managers to identify and measure the status of natural values and ecosystem components. A recent Marine Biodiversity Hub survey conducted detailed bathymetric and visual sampling of key seafloor habitat and fish assemblages in the Capes region of South-west Corner Marine Park (Western Australia). \n\nThis project analysed the Capes survey data to characterise and predict the broader distribution of natural values and ecosystem features, and to identify relevant indicators of fish and benthic assemblages for Park management. The results are presented alongside summaries of existing knowledge on natural, socio-economic, and cultural values, as well as human pressures. Recommendations include establishing national and international monitoring benchmarks and incorporating survey guidance from Traditional Owners.\n",

  "description": "Kelp forests create complex habitats that support a diverse and productive community of marine life. They underpin coastal food-webs, fisheries, and a suite of other ecosystem services including nutrient and blue carbon cycling. Across much of the world, kelp forests are in decline and under threat from stressors including urbanisation, overgrazing, ocean warming, and marine heatwaves driven by climate change.\n\nAustralia’s giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) forests are listed as a Threatened Ecological Community under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Habitat restoration is a potential tool for the conservation and management of giant kelp ecosystems. Given the direct impacts of climate change and ocean warming, there is growing recognition of the need for habitat restoration to be ‘future proofed’.\n\nFor restoration to be effective, the cause of habitat decline must be understood and overcome. This is problematic when climate change is driving habitat loss since it cannot be reversed or ameliorated prior to restoration. A previous NESP project led by this team ([NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub Project E7](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-e7-%E2%80%93-assessing-feasibility-restoring-giant-kelp-beds-eastern-tasmania.html)) identified warm-tolerant strains of giant kelp from remnant patches in eastern Tasmania, where the species has experienced precipitous declines due to ocean-warming. These strains have high potential to assist with ‘future-proofing’ kelp forest restoration, however it is still unclear what the physiological mechanisms are that provide their improved thermal tolerance. It is also unknown whether cross-breeding the identified warm-tolerant giant kelp strains will affect and potentially improve their thermal tolerance capacity.\n\nThis project explored the physiology of kelp thermal performance, specifically the mechanisms potentially responsible for the warm water tolerance identified in particular giant kelp strains. It confirmed the improved ability of the warm-tolerant strains to develop at stressful warm temperatures relative to normal giant kelp, and demonstrated for the first time that their improved thermal performance may extend to the development and fertilisation. The outcomes progress toward the identification of populations of Australian kelp that may be resilient to (or especially threatened by) ocean warming and climate change.",

  "description": "Climate change and population growth are accelerating the need for diverse solutions to coastal protection. Traditionally, shorelines are armoured with conventional \"hard\" or \"grey\" engineering structures such as seawalls which are non-adaptive and come with significant economic, environmental and social costs. While hard structures will continue to have a place in coastal protection, alternative methods that are more sustainable and climate-resilient should be more broadly adopted into the future where appropriate.\n\nLiving shorelines harness natural ecosystems to reduce coastal erosion and flooding and provide co-benefits such as carbon sequestration. They may consist of dunes, wetlands and biogenic reefs: either alone (‘soft approach’) or in combination with hard structures (‘hybrid approach’). To date, nature-based solutions have been underutilised in Australia, due at least in part to decision-makers needing clearer guidelines for when a soft, hybrid or hard coastal defence approach is most appropriate. This resulted in the publication of a foundational guide (led by Morris and Swearer and delivered under [ESCC Hub Project 5.9: Natural habitats for coastal protection and carbon sequestration](https://nespclimate.com.au/natural-habitats-for-coastal-protection-and-carbon-sequestration-project-5-9)) to inform the national use of nature-based methods for coastal hazard risk reduction. In the process of producing these guidelines, the lack of a national inventory of coastal protection projects already using nature-based methods was identified by end-users as a priority to enable their wider adoption as an adaptation strategy in Australia.\n\nThis project generated an online inventory of all current and planned on-ground actions by coastal land managers that have implemented a nature-based solution (NBS) to mitigate coastal hazards. From this, the [\"Living Shorelines Australia\"](https://livingshorelines.com.au) database was created. This inventory is the first step in identifying best practice, which will inform the future development of detailed technical design guidelines for implementing different nature-based methods in Australia.",

  "description": "Seabed and marine biodiversity data are time-consuming and costly to collect, so it is imperative that acquisition is focused on areas that align with end user priorities. The value that different stakeholders place on seabed and biodiversity data can be difficult to determine. Therefore, a shared process for identifying survey priorities is required to ensure the maximum shared benefit of future survey investment across research users, funding agencies, infrastructure providers, as well as the wider marine research community.\n\nThe project aimed to assist with the planning and prioritisation of marine surveys (both physical and biological) by scoping a prioritisation framework for marine surveys undertaking physical and biological seabed data collection in Australia. Focused workshops and targeted engagements with seabed mapping organisations were used to develop a standard set of metadata for agencies to define spatial Areas of Interest (AOI). The standard metadata were used in a prototype prioritisation framework that allows users to transparently and consistently rank and prioritise survey work or data delivery processes. The prioritisation is then based on rankings established by defined sets of criteria.\n\nA web-based AOI submission tool and mapping publication service was then developed for these defined areas as part of the AusSeabed Survey Coordination Tool. Adoption of this tool facilitates the development of an interim national areas of interest product to inform future survey planning. This product supports both the needs of Parks Australia's network Science Plans, and consideration of information needs for Indigenous Protected Areas within Sea Country.",

  "description": "Australian sea lion populations have declined by more than 60% over the past four decades. Abundance and trends vary markedly across the species range, suggesting that localised risk profiles from threats - such as bycatch, marine pollution, and habitat degradation - vary at small spatial scales. Fine scale variation in habitat use is thought to underpin these differences, yet knowledge about Australian sea lion's dependency on key habitats and their vulnerability to human impacts is limited.\n\nThis project deployed compact animal-borne cameras with GPS and motion sensors on eight adult female sea lions at two key colonies: Seal Bay (Southern Kangaroo Island Marine Park) and Olive Island (Western Eyre Marine Park). The devices recorded nearly 80 hours of footage over 560 km of seabed, identifying six distinct benthic habitat types, including previously unmapped rocky reefs and kelp forests.\n\nThe footage was used to develop fine-scale habitat maps using machine learning models, providing a valuable baseline for assessing ecological value, foraging intensity, and the effectiveness of protected areas. This innovative approach complements traditional seafloor mapping and offers a scalable, cost-effective method for locating and monitoring critical habitats for endangered marine species.\n\nThe results directly inform recovery planning, fisheries management, marine park design, and the identification of Biologically Important Areas. Ongoing camera deployments at Seal Bay and new sites along the western Eyre Peninsula will improve understanding of sea lion colony-specific behaviours and contribute to long-term monitoring of habitat change, diet, and emerging threats.",

  "description": "This project aims to address two overarching research questions: how can First Nations Peoples knowledges be reflected within (or alongside) Ecosystem Accounts prepared following the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting—Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA)? and what are suitable methods for appropriately gathering and presenting First Nations Peoples’ knowledges in relation to SEEA EA?\nTo achieve the project aim, researchers will partner with two First Nations groups from contrasting contexts and environments (northern QLD savannah and southern WA coast). Together we will trial methods and prepare full sets of SEEA EA compliant accounts for each group. By co-designing methods and accounts presentation, the aim is for the accounts to provide information that is useful for the groups themselves in addition to providing useful information for other research users.\nBeyond accounts preparation, and incorporating existing Australian literature, the project will develop and test overarching learnings and recommendations that can inform future EA policy development within DCCEEW. Working closely with our First Nations partners, and testing outputs with a small number of First Nations people from other organisations, the project will seek to identify common themes across different First Nations groups, and assess the relevance of, and links between, national accounting information (such as NEAP) and accounts built upon First Nations knowledge and perspectives. The project is also linked with the Nature Repair Market team within DCCEEW and will exchange learnings and findings with those working in that space, thus seeking to promote complementarity between EA and Nature Repair Market developments.",

  "description": "This project is using the western Cape York Peninsula and south-east Gulf of Carpentaria region as a case study to examine the relevance of existing risk-assessment frameworks and biodiversity maps for a regional approach to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).\n\nTo ensure biodiversity is protected, individual developments in northern Australia are currently assessed under the EPBC Act and other state planning legislation. However, there is a need to take a broader regional approach to assessing risks posed by the cumulative impacts of multiple developments.\n\nThe Cape York Peninsula and southern Gulf of Carpentaria region in Queensland is area of particular interest for future development. This includes proposals for mining, and water storage and extraction for irrigated agriculture. Each of these can impact water resources, biodiversity and culturally significant locations and values.\n\nAlthough the predicted impacts from individual developments may appear to be relatively minor, there is a risk that the ‘tyranny of small decisions’ could culminate in unexpected consequences for water quality, biodiversity and cultural values. This issue therefore provides a potential case study for an integrated, regional approach to identifying risks from development to environmental and cultural values.\n\nIn the first phase of the project, we are focusing on compiling information that can inform or be used in a future risk-assessment process. This includes collating tools, previous research outputs and a broad range of stakeholder perspectives so that the risk-assessment process is applicable across the study region and robust in a variety of situations. Additionally, we are examining current biodiversity maps, which are based on suitable habitats, to identify biodiversity hotspots, and compare these hotspots with potential water development areas.\n\nDuring the second phase we will work with a broader range of stakeholders to assess and refine the information collected in the first phase. Our team will then assess the information in the context of decadal patterns in water flows, possible future trends, and how these patterns might impact ecosystem productivity, health and cultural values over the long term.\n\nAs of October 2023, the project has been extended to include a third phase, where we will develop ecohydrological rules by integrating the research findings from phases 1 and 2, and studies in previous NESP and TRaCK projects, and others. This information will be used to inform water planning for the Gulf rivers. We will use new approaches for spatial mapping of water persistence into freely available models for water planning.\n\nThrough this project, we are providing information to improve outcomes for environmental and cultural values from the decision-making processes relevant to developments in the context of the EPBC Act and other risk-assessment schemes. We are also contributing to integrated planning and assessment work within an Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Environment Assessments Qld contract project and linking with the Marine and Coastal Hub’s project Supporting regional planning in northern Australia.",

The project will be co-designed with Traditional Owners, researchers, land managers and other research users to synergise perspectives, methods and research needs for this Priority Place. Our research efforts will focus on understanding where and under what circumstances parts of the landscape are buffered from over-exposure to fire and drought (i.e. ‘refugia’) and will also evaluate the broader ecological consequences of specific fire-management actions that are designed to conserve endemic/iconic taxa. Improving knowledge of the landscape processes that give rise to plant refugia and how management actions impact ecological integrity will help to refine current management practices, build in future landscape resilience, and provide tools and insights for the adaptive management approaches that will be required to improve the condition of the GBM WHA now and into the future.",

  "description": "To shift natural disaster management from ‘responding better’ to proactively preventing the worst outcomes, we will develop a culturally led framework for the identification and peer review of new, climate-targeted tools and strategies that will improve the resilience of our landscapes.\n\nPhase 1 of the project will focus on the development and refinement of a conceptual framework. The aim is to work with Traditional Owners – effectively and respectfully – to identify climate risks, impacts and observations on cultural and/or ecological values. We will then apply the Resist, Accept and Direct (RAD; Miller et al. 2007) approach to climate adaptation (if appropriate) to help develop the climate adaptation responses to specific landscape features or elements that are ecologically or culturally important. Traditional Owner led workshops will provide a culturally led priority list of issues of concern and gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed to respond to the likely impacts of climate change in a timely and effective way. The outputs of this phase (through reports and documents) will be a prioritised list of important cultural/ecological values that are at risk and in need of proactive strategies to build resilience across different ecosystem types. We will document how we use RAD to identify the type of climate adaptation response pathway that should be followed for each value and the concerns and gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. This will be used to frame the Phase 2 of the framework – ‘eco-thons’.\n\nPhase 2 of the conceptual framework is to take the prioritised list of values, and the kind of climate adaptation responses generated above to identify new ideas for solutions that could be refined and implemented as interventions on the ground. Each of the top 5 issues will be framed as a problem to workshop with specifically selected experts from a diversity of relevant fields in an eco-thon – a collaborative, environmentally focused, idea-generating workshop. The problem will be presented with the known gap and the parameters that must be met in order to be applicable on-ground. With representatives from First Nations people, scientists, engineers, conservators and farmers, these eco-thons will generate a broad range of potential management solutions and identify potential perverse outcomes. The output will be a peer-reviewed and prioritised (including benefits, costs, feasibility and risks) set of interventions ready to be implemented with some further testing of the strongest ideas, which is beyond the scope of this project. Traditional Owners will have right of veto of any idea through the process.\n\nPhase 3 of the project will review the conceptual framework and outline the lessons and recommendations of the process. This will be through evaluation by those who have participated in the first 2 phases of the project as well as independent evaluation by experts to make recommendations for refinement for future applications. The outcomes include application of this framework in real-world scenarios beyond this project.\n\nThis culturally led, evidence-based, transparent approach will raise awareness, enthusiasm and funding for the proactive measures that will be much needed in the coming years. The development and implementation of the identified tools and strategies are out of scope for this project.\n",

  "description": "This project aims to develop a climate change adaptation plan for focal threatened species and ecosystems of the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales (component 1) (already approved and underway) and the Wet Tropics of Queensland (component 2) (seeking approval for commencement 2025). \n\nComponent 1 Northern Rivers\nThe climate change adaptation plan will be designed to be embedded in planning and initiatives by local communities and governments. A bottom-up, community-based approach will be taken, working with local Landcare and species-monitoring groups, NSW North Coast Local Land Services (LLS) and Indigenous organisations. Our process will integrate with adaptation and resilience planning being undertaken by relevant local, state and federal government agencies.\nMany threatened species and several threatened ecological communities occur in the region. Significant wetlands, national parks, World Heritage areas, declared Aboriginal Areas, Indigenous Protected Areas and Indigenous Land Use Agreements are also found here. The region was home to the ‘Big Scrub’ subtropical rainforest, 75,000 ha of which was intensively cleared for agriculture. Less than 1% of this ecosystem remains. \nThe project will deliver applied research outcomes for stakeholders, including data, information and tools needed to support effective and appropriate adaptation actions for addressing climate-related risks to species and ecosystems in the region. The approaches and tools developed will be transferable to other regions.\n\nComponent 2 Wet Tropics\nThe same methodology will be used for a community-centred approach to climate change adaptation plan for focal threatened species and ecosystems developed for the Northern Rivers project. However, while the fundamentals of the methodology will remain the same, the approach will be modified to take into account the local contexts found in the Wet Tropics of Queensland; such modifications being co-developed with our partners, particularly WTMA, Terrain, FNQROC and the First Nations groups representing the twenty Rainforest Aboriginal Groups whose traditional lands fall within the Wet Tropics WHA. \nAs with Component 1 (Northern Rivers), this Wet Tropics component will deliver applied research outcomes for stakeholders and First Nations partners, including data, information and tools needed to support effective and appropriate adaptation actions for addressing climate-related risks to species and ecosystems in the region. Specific outputs and tools will be co-developed to ensure they complement existing resources and meet specific user needs.",

  "description": "The existing NESP project, Guiding the Strategic Management of Freshwater fish, was originally developed as a desktop project designed to use existing statewide datasets to then work with river managers to develop principles and approaches that can be used to manage and protect freshwater fish biodiversity in rivers and streams across Victoria. However, since the original project plan was developed, discussions with DEECA and others have led to a narrowing of focus to primarily consider threats to a small group of fishes that were once common in floodplain wetlands of the southern Murray-Darling Basin and more specifically in selected key Victorian catchments. A number of these species are now listed under National and/or State threatened species Legislation (including flathead galaxias, Murray hardyhead), while others (e.g. southern pygmy perch) have declined considerably in their distribution and abundance in recent decades and are increasingly being considered for listing Nationally in addition to existing State listings. Compared to riverine habitats, information on the status of wetland fish is comparatively sparse, and there has been limited research into, and investment in, strategies to restore local populations. Currently there is a tendency therefore to rely on restocking as the primary means for restoring local populations, but limited work to understand the success of restoration activities in the presence/absence of other management interventions. The revised project aims to fill this gap, and will generate information that will feed into regional and statewide management strategies. \nThe updated project goals remain consistent with those in the original plan, but with a much narrower geographic and habitat focus, and a more bottom-up approach, involving more on-ground sampling and greater engagement with local land-managers, including Traditional Owners. The project will synthesise existing data and knowledge about threatened floodplain species, their current distributions, current threats (including invasive species, wetland persistence, and their likely future distributions given threats they are facing now and into the future. We will also undertake a global assessment of the literature to assess the global trends in wetland restoration techniques and synthesis this information to provide advice to support the management of wetland habitats within Victoria and river-floodplain habitats more generally.\n",

  "description": "The Queensland Threatened Lizard Survey (2021–2026) conducted surveys and fieldwork on the eleven species of threatened squamate (lizard and snake) in Queensland. This resulted in the rediscovery of Lyon’s grassland striped skink, which had not been seen since 1981 (42 years). The surveys also found a new site for the McIlwraith Range leaf-tailed gecko, which was formerly known from a handful of sightings at one site.\n\nImportantly, the surveys for seven other threatened Queensland squamate species resulted in improved knowledge of the distribution of these species and the threats that they face. The survey work did not detect either the Fassifern blind snake (not seen since 1992) or the Gravel-downs Ctenotus (not recorded since 1984). Overall, this project has improved our knowledge of the conservation status of the most imperilled squamate species in Queensland. \n\nThe research built on the findings of a [comprehensive review of the conservation status of Australian lizards and snakes carried out in 2017](https://ebooks.publish.csiro.au/content/action-plan-australian-lizards-and-snakes-2017), and a project to [identify the reptile species most at risk of extinction](https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/pc20033) over the next 20 years.

We will experimentally test one ecologically based management lever, using removal of rabbit warrens to reduce predation risk from cats, and create safer patches in a large landscape, specifically for the western quoll (D. geoffroyi). We will produce a resource, accessible to diverse end-users on how to diagnose the problem and design solutions at local scale to create safer situations for wildlife within large, unfenced landscapes.",

The mass mortality of Australian flying-foxes at roosts during heatwaves has been well documented, with future extreme heat events considered the greatest threat to their survival. This project aims to improve our understanding of the local thermal environments of SFF roosts across their range, which is a critical aspect of their sensitivity to the increasing risks imposed by climate change. By doing so, this project will improve species management through the provision of tools to mitigate the devastating impacts of future extreme heatwaves and advise managers on effective interventions. This project addresses national priorities by providing adaptive solutions to support the recovery of a threatened species and in developing capacity to help reverse the decline in Australia’s natural environment.\n",

  "description": "Resilient, productive and sustainable landscapes support Australia’s rich biodiversity and agricultural and tourism economies, and are central to every Australian’s identity and wellbeing.\n\nIndigenous Australians’ cultural practices have sustainably managed these landscapes for millennia. However, our rangelands, agricultural and peri-urban landscapes – and even our protected areas – face increasingly complex environmental challenges. These challenges erode landscape condition and undermine capacity to recover from threatening processes and extreme events.\n\nTo protect Australia’s landscapes and the services they provide, merely maintaining resilience will not be enough, particularly given the changing climate. Instead, we need to find new ways to enhance and restore resilience.\n\nEnvironmental research has played a critical role in articulating the key threats to the resilience of our landscapes by:\n\n- describing declines in landscape condition, species abundance and distributions\n- predicting future threats\n- proposing and prioritising actions that should be taken to address them.\n\nSuch research has been critical for raising awareness about the magnitude of the threats to biodiversity and the urgent need to address them.\n\nDespite progress on identifying and prioritising threats, surprisingly little research in ecology and environmental science has actually focused on solutions.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub’s research program is based on a proposed approach we are calling ‘solutions science’. This user-driven, solutions-focused, co-research model brings academic and non-academic partners together to address the scientific and societal challenges of strengthening and restoring resilience in Australia’s landscapes.\n\nThis project focuses on developing and testing better ways to do applied environmental science. This includes supporting the development and implementation of the core components of our solutions-science approach.",

  "description": "The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) outlines key goals and targets that specifically acknowledge the importance of protecting, conserving and managing land and water effectively. While protected areas are well understood and studied, conserved and managed lands and their role in delivering environmental and social outcomes are not. To this end, ‘other effective area-based conservation measures’ (OECMs; termed ‘conserved areas’ in Target 3 of the GBF) will contribute alongside protected areas to meet area-based measures of 30% of land and sea by 2030. Similarly, managed areas which surround and connect protected and conserved areas are essential for meeting the broader goal that the integrity, connectivity and resilience of ecosystems are maintained and enhanced. Protected, conserved and managed areas will necessarily work in tandem to improve landscape-scale habitat quality and connectivity and, ultimately, overall persistence of biodiversity.\nThis project will review private-land conservation programs against the draft Australian OECM framework criteria to indicate the types of programs that are likely to qualify. Based on this review, programs that are near OECM standard but that fall short on key criteria, such as actively managing for biodiversity outcomes, will be considered for place-based research. Within programs, the research will design and deploy interventions to support landholders to manage their land consistent with OECM criteria and track the outcomes of this management over time to demonstrate enduring biodiversity outcomes. The research will demonstrate if the hypothesised benefits to both biodiversity and participants of these programs (e.g. increased nature connectedness) hold true. If our findings are positive, we expect these interventions could be added to private-land conservation programs in other jurisdictions.",

  "description": "This project focuses on developing innovative tools using satellite imagery to map and monitor persistent pools (waterholes) within Australian rivers and floodplains. Persistent pools are vital water resources, especially under climate change and growing water use. They are crucial for ecosystems, providing habitats for species, sustaining ecological processes and serving as refuges during dry periods. The project will use satellite data from Landsat, Sentinel and Planetscope to map these pools, assess their dynamics, and predict future changes under various climate and water-use scenarios. The findings will support sustainable management strategies, including water allocation, climate adaptation and conservation efforts, with case studies in the Martuwarra Fitzroy River (WA), Gilbert River (Qld) and the Ovens River in Northern Victoria.\n\nPersistent pools are challenging to map due to their dynamic nature, shifting with changes in flow and precipitation. Current methods do not adequately capture these fluctuations, leading to potential underestimation of the area of persistent pools. The increasing demand for water resources, combined with climate change, underscores the need for better mapping and monitoring techniques. Remote sensing offers an efficient, cost-effective way to track these dynamic features across large areas, providing historical and real-time data to inform management decisions. This project aims to fill the gap in current methods by integrating data from multiple satellites and analysing the ecological and socio-cultural implications of pool dynamics.",

  "description": "This project aims to identify practical solutions for catchment-scale restoration and threatened-species recovery in south-east Queensland (Qld). Recent extreme weather events (causing severe droughts, heat waves, wildfire and floods), habitat degradation and invasive species are posing increasing risks to the resilience and long-term persistence of highly valued and threatened freshwater species and the integrity of critical wetland habitats in the region. The project will focus on the Mary River (Moonaboola) catchment in Queensland – a hotspot of threatened freshwater and riparian species (including the Mary River turtle, Australian lungfish, giant barred frog and water mouse) that flows into the Ramsar-listed Great Sandy Strait, adjacent to the K’gari (Fraser Island) World Heritage area.\nBy working with local catchment natural-resource management (NRM) groups, Traditional Owners, governments and other stakeholders, this project will:\n• fill critical knowledge gaps on threatened species distributions and habitat requirements, ecological and cultural values, and threats\n• prioritise on-ground restoration actions to benefit multiple threatened species\n• undertake targeted implementation trials of habitat-restoration measures for key species\n• design a monitoring program to evaluate restoration success.\nThe project will deliver applied research outcomes to support ecosystem restoration after extreme events and planning for threatened-species recovery at national and state levels. The approaches developed and trialled in this project will be transferable to other catchments and threatened species. ",

  "description": "Peatlands in the Australian Alps face a range of threats; however, their remoteness and fragmented distribution makes ongoing condition assessment challenging. This project will assist in the management of alpine peatlands by developing tools for the assessment of peatland condition historically and into the future. To do this, we will integrate satellite remote sensed data with on-ground hydrological and floristic data, validated using higher resolution satellite and hyperspectral drone imaging to generate condition time series across broad regional areas. These tools will be affordable, simple to use and will allow land managers to assess peatland condition as and when required. (100/100). \nThe work directly addresses the national priority areas of ‘Soil and Water’ (new and integrated national observing systems) and ‘Environmental Change’ (predicting and measuring the impact of environmental change).",

  "description": "Climate change and habitat loss pose significant threats to the fauna of Western Australia's southwest, a region recognized as a globally important biodiversity hotspot. Over recent decades, rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall, compounded by habitat loss, have led to numerous local extinctions. As climate change and habitat fragmentation continue to intensify, the risk of further extinctions grows.\nTo address these challenges, conservation landscape corridors have been proposed as an important solution. These corridors aim to enhance species dispersal by facilitating gene flow between fragmented fauna populations, thereby increasing their access to larger habitats and improving their resilience to climate change by boosting their adaptive capacity. However, ensuring these corridors achieve maximum effectiveness requires a strong understanding of where they are likely to be best positioned within the landscape, as well as the minimum habitat requirements for them to be effective for the species they are intended to support.\nOur research aims to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of existing landscape corridors within the megadiverse Fitz-Stirling region by conducting intensive surveys across multiple tenure types to inform habitat suitability models for a suite of target threatened species including chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), quokka (Setonix brachyurus), dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis), and malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata). Additionally, using reptiles as a surrogate for broader small vertebrate communities, we will use genetic data to map dispersal resistance across the broader landscape to identify optimal areas for future restoration. The combination of these approaches will allow us to determine how well current corridors facilitate species movement and gene flow while also guiding the strategic placement of new corridors and restoration efforts to maximize their impact on biodiversity conservation.",

  "description": "Project summary\nFollowing discussions with Commonwealth and Regional research users, this project will include 4 major components:\n\n1 - Land managers from the Fitz-Stirling region in Western Australia require assistance to improve management of feral cats and red foxes.  The region has experienced researchers and managers, and collaboration with hub researchers will result in analysis and interpretation of existing data to inform future management. However, despite impressive local efforts to understand the ecology of invasive predators in the region, research users have identified opportunities for Hub research to build on existing knowledge to further mitigate the impacts of cats and red foxes on wildlife. Hub researchers will work with local research users to collect new data on target animals and incorporate these into practical recommendations for best-practice management (including monitoring) of feral cats and red foxes in the Fitz-Stirling Priority Place. This project will engage with and complement other work using existing cat-management data collected in the Fitz-Stirlings, and has been codesigned with end-users (WA DBCA and Bush Heritage).\n\n2 - The Commonwealth Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) and Saving Native Species (SNS) programs are exposed to significant risk from uncertainty related to the variable quality of feral cat and red fox monitoring program designs and the metrics they produce. This exemplifies an ongoing barrier to advancing feral cat and red fox management; ‘how do we monitor these species effectively?’ (this is a key issue in both the cat and fox threat abatement plans). This project will support NHT & SNS Service Providers and inform future management of the NHT program by investigating the statistical power of approved monitoring programs (Research questions: Can they detect what they want to detect; what is best practice monitoring of cats and foxes; how does this compare to what is currently being implemented at these sites; and is best practice monitoring cost effective?) and by operating three demonstration sites (Fitz-Stirlings, Kangaroo Island, Booderee NP) where ‘best practice’ monitoring will be implemented alongside existing monitoring programs, to contextualise typical monitoring outcomes (Research question: ‘What do monitoring metrics mean?’).  Guidance and training material on best practice monitoring and analysis will be a key output, alongside a shiny app that facilitates easy analysis of camera trap data using occupancy models. \n\n3 - Land managers on Kangaroo Island seek assistance in improving feral cat management in relation to leaky fences and understanding movements at low densities. An existing safe haven on Kangaroo Island is challenged with a leaky fence, providing the opportunity for Hub researchers to test the efficacy of sound-producing devices in keeping cats from breaching the fence. GPS telemetry will also improve our understanding of how cats traverse the landscape at low densities, which will assist with targeting management actions in these situations. \n\n4 - Synthesise our understanding of predator-prey interactions using the comprehensive datasets obtained from NESP projects in the Fitz-Stirlings, Uluru-Kata Tjuta, Kangaroo Island and Booderee National Park, as well as the information collected in sub-project 2. These sites have had extensive camera trapping occurring therein, which will yield information on presence and absence, that can be used in a multi-species occupancy modelling framework to determine the drivers of mesopredator interactions. This will provide evidence as to whether these interactions are driven by top-down or bottom-up factors. \n",

  "description": "Many challenges for resilient landscapes are attributable to people – but people are an essential part of solutions that strengthen and restore resilience. Good data and information are necessary but not sufficient on their own, as outcomes also depend on social and economic values, norms and behaviours. There is a need for socioeconomic research to better evaluate, plan and implement actions.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub has been tasked with addressing several socioeconomic research priorities which could help reduce the impacts of the multiple pressures on Australia’s ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nOne priority is to evaluate the success of different environmental plans, strategies or actions (such as offsets and biodiversity markets, regulations, and changes to curriculum through Education for Sustainability principles) on biodiversity outcomes. This evaluation may use methods such as environmental economic accounting or environmental valuation.\n\nA second area of priority relates to planning approaches. This involves designing systems to analyse cumulative impact and regional planning assessments. These can inform the design of policies and plans, including offsets policies, and may include information about environmental values, costs and benefits. Regional planning could include integrated, landscape-scale planning – including strengthening the links between research and regional natural resource management planning – and improved resilience planning, particularly in the context of a changing climate and multiple interacting threats.\n\nFinally, implementation focuses on the motivations, incentives, and organisational and societal norms that influence the extent to which environmental plans, policies and actions are able to change behaviours and generate positive on-ground environmental outcomes.",

  "description": "This project aims to support the strategic management of invasive grasses in northern Australia – in particular, gamba grass, para grass and olive hymenachne – to reduce their impacts on biodiversity. This project will provide support to managers of protected areas and Indigenous ranger groups through co-development of user-friendly mapping, monitoring and decision-support tools. The project will also support more effective threat-abatement programs by identifying methods for prioritising areas for on-ground control and rehabilitation of ecosystems invaded by these weeds.\n",

  "description": "Australia faces many significant pressures that lead to the degradation of our ecosystems and the decline of our biodiversity, including our threatened flora and fauna. Appropriate monitoring approaches are required to provide baseline data and identify ongoing trends.\n\nMonitoring of environmental conditions and trends underpins policy and operational decision-making. Historically, monitoring required input by specialised personnel, making it costly and highly targeted.\n\nEmerging technologies are increasing opportunities for remote or passive monitoring and the recruitment of non-specialist input, including citizen science. However, the use of new technologies creates new challenges for the management of large volumes of monitoring data.\n\nThis project explores the application of new technologies to understand how to prioritise different monitoring tools and approaches, and integrate monitoring into broader management systems. The project also contributes to the development of new standards for environmental monitoring.",

  "description": "This project aims to improve ecosystem restoration in Australia, with a particular focus on improving biodiversity monitoring of restoration projects. It will achieve this by undertaking 3 linked activities.\n• Activity 1: stakeholder workshop\n• Activity 2: examining methods used for restoration monitoring and evaluation\n• Activity 3: evaluating biodiversity outcomes of key restoration projects.\nThis research is foundational for enhancing biodiversity recovery, strengthening restoration program delivery, encouraging informed restoration investments, and meeting national environmental standards. It directly addresses knowledge gaps around restoration identified in the Australia State of the Environment 2021 report and current national priorities for biodiversity conservation and restoration.\nNote that this project is Phase 2 of the ‘Restoration by design’ project. Phase 1 is a small project currently underway (4.5 Phase 1: September 2023 – June 2024) which includes running a co-design workshop (planned for the first quarter of 2024) with a subset of stakeholders identified in this proposal. Project 4.5 Phase 1 is key to Project 4.5 Phase 2 of this project, as it is the formal start of the complex and time-consuming process of identification and consultation with stakeholders. Project 4.5 Phase 2 also aims to begin development of the program logic required for key parts of the project more broadly – specifically, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of restoration monitoring methods (there are many) and the inclusion/exclusion criteria for case studies to include in our detailed analysis here (again, there are many).",

  "description": "This project is trialling the use of specially trained detection dogs to sniff out the critically endangered Victorian grassland earless dragon. The dragon – a cryptic lizard that was presumed to be extinct – was recently rediscovered in grasslands in Victoria’s west. The lizard had not been seen in more than 50 years, despite many searches. New methods are needed to find any remaining populations in the grasslands of the Victorian Volcanic Plain.\n\nThis project is supporting the [Zoos Victoria Wildlife Detection Dog Squad](https://www.zoo.org.au/fighting-extinction/fighting-extinction-dog-squad/) to train dogs to detect the Victorian grassland earless dragon by harnessing the dogs’ exceptional sense of smell. Having better ways to find the dragon is critical to its conservation by providing much-needed information about its populations, ecology and habitat use. Locating more dragons for a conservation-breeding program and insurance population is another way to save them from extinction.\n\nIf this project shows that detection dogs can successfully find this lizard, it could be a game-changer in the conservation of this and other imperilled Australian reptiles.",

Presently, very little information exists to assist managers of biodiversity adapt to climate change. At the same time, NESP projects are producing research, data and outputs that can be of assistance to land and sea managers responding to climate change.\nAn online adaptation decision support and knowledge platform will assist biodiversity managers as well as provide a platform for all four NESP hubs to house outputs relevant to climate adaptation for biodiversity. Through information synthesis, careful curation, codesign and collaboration with NESP projects, project 4.3 will build a climate adaptation knowledge platform for biodiversity.\nThe Resilient Landscape Hub has identified up to 17 projects that could be potentially linked and/or provide case studies for this project Adapt Land & Sea (i.e. formerly referred to as ‘ConservationAdapt’). This proposal is to contribute funds to develop written content for the web site/fact sheets for these relevant Resilient Landscape Hub projects and support the website development. ",

  "description": "More than half of the Australian land mass is now acknowledged to be part of the Indigenous estate through more than 450 Native Title determinations and over 1,230 registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements.\n\nThere is a fundamental need for better planning, prioritisation and evaluation to inform the management of this estate, while reconnecting and strengthening Indigenous peoples’ connections to their culture and their Country. This need is further strengthened by the fact that 54% of the National Reserve System is conferred through the Indigenous conservation estate in the form of Indigenous Protected Areas and jointly managed conservation reserves.\n\nThis Indigenous conservation estate supports a large number of Australia’s threatened species and their populations. Like other areas in Australia, the Indigenous estate is not immune to the major pressures that lead to ecosystem degradation and decline of biodiversity, including those impacting on threatened species and ecological communities.\n\nThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has tasked the hub with identifying, prioritising and undertaking the research required to support Indigenous knowledge, the management of the Indigenous estate and the mutual benefits this will deliver to the Australian environment.\n\nSimilarly, Indigenous Australians have identified and articulated a series of research needs, particularly for the management of Indigenous Protected Areas, in their response to the outcomes of the first phase of the National Environmental Science Program.\n\nThis project is co-designing projects that respond to these needs. This project also confirms an Indigenous voice in the governance and operations of the Resilient Landscapes Hub through the refinement and final endorsement of the Indigenous Partnerships Strategy.",

  "description": "Primary producers face increasing pressure from financial stakeholders, supply chains and consumers to demonstrate they farm sustainably to gain and maintain market access. A challenge is to identify management actions that can maintain or improve nature-positive outcomes without compromising farm production or profitability. Simultaneously, there are emerging opportunities for producers to diversify their income through nature markets. In collaboration with the CSIRO-led Ecological Knowledge Systems project, we will use stateand-transition models as a framework to integrate existing knowledge, expert elicitation and empirical data collection to test and validate the effectiveness of key interventions (reduced fertiliser application, strategic grazing) for improving biodiversity on ~10-15 farms in each of three geographic regions (Tasmanian Midlands, Western Victorian Volcanic Plains, Naracoorte Coastal Plain). The project will generate a stronger foundation for the sector to transition to a higher biodiversity future, inform opportunities to reduce input costs while maintaining productivity, and enable producers to leverage emerging nature markets, sustainability reporting and natural capital accounting.",

  "description": "One of Australia’s key obligations under the Ramsar Convention is to maintain the ecological character of its internationally listed Ramsar wetlands, with these responsibilities shared by the Australian Government in partnership with state and territory governments and nongovernment site managers.\nAustralia’s 66 Ramsar wetlands cover more than 8.3 million hectares and exhibit a range of biophysical and ecological characteristics (DAWE, 2022). Each Ramsar wetland is essentially unique in the context of spatial and temporal pressures on ecological character. Appropriate monitoring, using context-specific indicators, is key to understanding changes in condition and ecological character of Ramsar sites in response to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. A well-designed monitoring program can provide critical information to enable site managers to adaptively manage and assess the effectiveness of management interventions and actions to restore and improve condition.\nGiven the specific spatial and temporal context of each Ramsar wetland, this project will develop a better understanding of the monitoring frameworks appropriate for use at Ramsar sites and identify current knowledge gaps to guide research and development of tools to build capacity to monitor and manage Ramsar wetlands.\n",

  "description": "Climate change and, in some cases, our mitigation and adaptation responses pose major risks to Australia’s biodiversity and landscapes. Yet it is biodiversity that provides the resilience (response diversity1) needed for nature, people and economies to cope, adapt and transform under a changing climate. It is a priority to enhance regional natural resource management (NRM) planning processes and capabilities to consider the risks and opportunities from large uncertain change and build investment cases to fund responses to these. By adapting and enhancing the ‘enabling resilience investment’ (ERI) approach in a pilot application with an NRM region in Australia, this project aims to build capabilities and coherence in biodiversity-adaptation assessment, planning and investment decision-making, and generate transferable principles and lessons that help scale these across NRM regions.",

  "description": "The Challenge\nClimate change contributes to an increased frequency of extreme weather events in Australia, such as heatwaves, floods, bushfires, and droughts. As a result, the agricultural sector faces tougher and more unpredictable weather conditions. \n\nThis makes it more difficult for farmers to manage their farming practices and select the optimal crop breeds, since different breeds have varying resistance to drought and disease, with clear consequences for our food security and economy.\n\nVarious research organisations, government departments, industries and rural research and development corporations invest in trials to understand how factors such as weather, soil and pests affect crop growth and quality. However, since the data are generated from a range of sources, they often differ in their format, scale, frequency and precision. \n\nThis makes it challenging to compare the data, and to understand the true relationships between the crops and their environment. Understanding and modelling these relationships is crucial to inform agricultural management practices and maximise yield.\n\nThe Approach\nWe are supporting our partner, the Australian Plant Phenomics Network, to standardise access to Australia’s crop research data. The project is working with established research farms and agricultural/ecological research facilities across the nation to develop a framework, standards and recommendations for sharing agricultural data in a clear and consistent way. \n\nTest data from these research farms and facilities will be used to establish data management protocols. The protocols will be created according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data principles, which will allow the data to be easily used and compared. \n\nThe project will also develop user access tools that integrate time series information about crops and their environment. This will give researchers the ability to more easily compare data on crop growth, performance, weather and other dynamic influences over time. \n\nUsing this project as a ‘proof of concept,’ this model can be expanded to the whole agricultural sector or adopted by other sectors in future.\n\nBy standardising agricultural data and developing tools that integrate information about crops and their environment, researchers will be able to work towards developing optimised breeds of crops that can withstand Australia’s changing climate. It will also enable the sector to more reliably monitor, predict, and optimise their agricultural practices to safeguard our food security.",

  "description": "The BREATHE study aims to test a computerised system to improve the accuracy and efficiency of assessing and managing patients with breathlessness. It will use a pre-consultation screening tool to identify undiagnosed breathlessness (BREATHE SMART) and an integrated clinical decision support system (BREATHE CDSS) in the electronic health record to support general practitioners (GPs) to better assess and care for patients with breathlessness in primary care. Each patient identified as having chronic breathlessness and consents to the BREATHE CDSS project will participate for 12 months. In this study we will assess the benefits of these tools for patients and GPs in reaching a diagnosis, commencing evidence-based management and achieving relief of breathlessness.",

Next, a tailored psychotherapy program will be developed and delivered, informed by the survey and interview data. The program will incorporate mixed-method data collection, including therapy session recordings and arts-based research methods. Finally, follow-up interviews will examine participants’ experiences and constructions of the psychotherapy program. This research addresses a gap in women’s health and mental health, with the potential to enhance psychotherapeutic support for PMC.",

  "description": "Consecrated life is a divine gift from God to the Church through the Holy Spirit, rooted deeply in the example and teachings of Christ (Pope Paul, 1996). Consecrated life communities, as described by Kanu (2019) and Noronha (2019), are unique societal structures where individuals, guided by the Holy Spirit, commit to poverty, chastity, and obedience, dedicating themselves to God and symbolising the life to come. This research aims to enhance understanding of leader-member relationships within these communities, thereby contributing to their overall well-being, and sustainability. The study aims to illuminate specific leadership approaches, leadership development, and subjective well-being and community environment within these unique settings. To achieve this, the study will employ a small-scale autoethnography, drawing on my personal experiences as a community member. Additionally, a combination of qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews and focus groups, will be applied to captivate diverse perspectives from leaders and members. The anticipated outcomes of this research include a comprehensive understanding of leader-member dynamics within consecrated life communities and practical insights to bridge generational and relational gaps. The findings could potentially inform leadership practices and contribute to the well-being of these communities, thereby having a significant societal impact.",

Others are stuck in relationships they are not happy with. And, some have given-up on having relationships altogether. The concept of relationship sabotage can explain why and how this phenomenon occurs; however no empirical research existed in this area until recently. Research needs to continue to further validate the newly developed Relationship Sabotage Scale. Additionally, research in this area will benefit from exploring how individuals’ differences contribute to relationship difficulties in young people and adults. ",

First, we will conduct a cross-sectional study evaluating the prevalence of frailty with and without obesity at the time of first assessment by the heart-lung clinic. Secondly, we will perform a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of frailty and obesity on transplant-related outcomes. The study will determine whether frailty predicts outcomes independent of obesity or amplifies the effect of obesity on outcomes. Patients will be stratified into obese-frail, obese-non-frail, non-obese-frail, and non-obese-non-frail groups based on frailty assessment at baseline, and outcomes will be compared between these groups.",

  "description": "This research project explores how Years 3–4 teachers in the Diocese of Sale Catholic Education Limited (DOSCEL) perceive Religious Education (RE) and the professional development (PD) and formation they receive or seek. While RE is central to the mission of Catholic education, many generalist primary teachers report feeling underprepared to teach it confidently and meaningfully. Using a qualitative phenomenological approach, this study will gather data through semi-structured interviews and narrative-style surveys. It aims to capture teachers’ lived experiences, highlight the challenges they face, and identify the kinds of PD and formation that would most support their RE teaching practice. The findings will offer insights into how diocesan policies and curriculum frameworks align with classroom realities, and will inform future development of RE-specific PD that is theologically grounded, practically relevant, and responsive to teacher needs. This research contributes to strengthening Catholic identity through more effective and supportive teacher formation.",

The novel study will be a case control examination of the first wave of Covid-19 using a 2019 and 2020 comparison cohort. \t\nA retrospective medical chart review was conducted in 2022, using 2,353 patient notes to document lifestyle behaviours such as smoking, alcohol use for harm, malnutrition, physical fitness, high body mass index, and frailty on patient health questionnaires or related pre-surgery notes. Further analysis will be conducted using this cohort to investigate the significance of lifestyle behaviour changes during the Covid-19 phase in early 2020 and significance to post surgery outcomes associated with extended waitlist times to surgery. \nThe implications of this research will inform decision making for preparations and planning for future pandemics on the delivery of elective surgery services and patient healthy lifestyle information prior to surgery.",

  "description": "Background: Children and young people (0–16 years, 17–24 years) with intellectual disability have long been known to experience inequities in accessing healthcare1,2. They show a significant difference in health outcomes and life expectancy when compared with the general population. Sometimes this is associated with their diagnosis or disability but is more commonly a result of healthcare barriers and systems that do not meet their needs. In addition, for those who receive healthcare, many have negative experiences, including adverse patient safety events such as medication errors, wrong procedures or iatrogenic injury3,4. One of the key barriers cited in literature relates to be difficulties in identification of flagging of these children and young people in need of reasonable adjustments5. In response the Sydney Children’s Hospital’s network (SCHN) has developed an alert and flagging system – All About Me- that staff can use to record information about the child or young person in need of adjustments.  It is meant to inform clinical teams whether they need to make reasonable adjustments to improve the safety, quality and experience of hospital care for vulnerable children and young people.   Aim: To investigate the reach of the All About Me improvement initiative. Research questions: 1) what is the efficacy of the time  in enabling reasonable adjustments and 2) what is the impact on children and adolescents with intellectual and developmental disability ID/IDD experience and outcomes.",

This research has a non-experimental mixed methods design that aims to collect two types of data: quantitative data via an anonymous survey (phase one), followed by semi-structured interviews from a random sample of Australian teachers (classroom, learning support, literacy coaches) working in Foundation (year before year 1) to year 3 classrooms (phase two & three). The research utilises both quantitative and qualitative methods. The methods are mixed as an anonymous online survey (using Qualtrics) was used to gather objective and measurable data. This data will be uploaded to and analysed using SPSS software. Interviews will be recorded on Teams and transcribed and analysed using Nvivo software.",

The original P4 study (Postpartum physiology, psychology and paediatric) enrolled participants at St George hospital, who gave birth in the preceding 6-months. The participants were normotensive, had gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia and were assessed at six-months, two-years and five-years after birth for anthropometric, blood pressure, and psychological assessment. The babies were examined by a paediatrician and their mother, at each time-point, and a psychologist at two-years. The substudy investigates the participants’ experience throughout P4, through a questionnaire administered at the 5-year time-point that includes two open-ended questions and a closed-question allowing participants the opportunity to provide feedback on their clinical trial experience. The data collected will procure an understanding of the impacts of clinical trials on participants, aiding researchers in creating studies that are acceptable and welcomed by the general population.

Ultrasound (US) has been used as a measure to detect IFM muscular atrophy in DPN patients. In addition, exercise is beneficial in delaying the usual course of DPN, skin damage and ulceration. However, diabetic patients have lower physical activity rates due to limitations such as difficult access to therapy, poor compliance, and limited support to maintain exercise therapy. Therefore, this study aims to assess whether a newly developed biofeedback device, 'Archercise' – a foot muscle exercise and strengthening tool, can correlate IFM Cross-Sectional Area (CSA) measured by US with foot arch control and performance.",

  "description": "Description textAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrythmia increasing the risk of stroke and limiting one’s ability to carry out day to day activities. Catheter ablation uses various forms of energy to ablate aberrant parts of the left atrium, thus restoring a normal rhythm. While this treatment is effective for patients with short-lasting AF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), the outcomes for patients with longer standing AF, persistent AF (PsAF) and long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF), are suboptimal. The Hybrid Catheter Ablation and Surgical Ablation (HyCASA) procedure was developed to treat patients with difficult-to-treat AF. It combines catheter ablation of the endocardium, performed by a cardiologist, with surgical ablation of the epicardium, performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon, in either a staged or concurrent approach. This procedure has the advantage of creating a durable lesion of the posterior left atrium while minimizing the risk of damage to local structures, such as the oesophagus. This procedure has been shown to be more effective than catheter ablation alone for PsAF and LsPAF, with acceptable safety.  \nOur primary aim is to investigate the efficacy of the HyCASA procedure in patients with AF who have previously failed at least one catheter ablation and anti-arrythmic drugs. Procedural efficacy will be demonstrated by the proportion of patients who fail the procedure over at least 12 months of follow up time. We will also demonstrate efficacy using AF burden over 12 months, where AF burden is the time spent in AF divided by the total monitoring time. \nThis is important research to conduct because it provides evidence as to whether the HyCASA procedure is a viable option for patients with AF who failed catheter ablation and anti-arrythmic drugs previously.",

Australian guidelines recommend iron testing and treatment, but the real-world implementation and impact are unclear. Utilising MBS and other data in the National Health Data Hub, linked to the National Echo Database of Australia, this required information can be obtained, delivering efficient, evidence-based healthcare measures while ensuring privacy. The data will benchmark iron testing against guidelines, evaluate the impact of timely intravenous iron therapy, assess outcomes like hospitalisations and mortality, and guide clinical decisions on choosing the correct MBS iron item and retesting frequency. It will empower patients to discuss results with clinicians and improve clinical support tools across disciplines. The initiative aims to drive practice change, enhance patient awareness, support ongoing research, and set a precedent for using linked MBS/PBS data.",

Studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with congenital deafness also have additional medical comorbidities, many of which are associated with poorer surgical and developmental outcomes. Importantly, patients with medical comorbidities are frequently excluded from cochlear implant studies, so published research investigating outcomes may not accurately reflect a large proportion of the patient population. PCH is the main tertiary implant clinic for paediatric patients in the state, and having more information about the prevalence of comorbidities within the implant patient population may influence future outcomes for these patients. This project would allow implant teams to contextualise the outcomes for patients more broadly by comparing those with and without medical comorbidities. The findings will be important for future service provision and planning and allow comparison of outcomes with the literature and other implant centres with a similar comorbid composition.",

  "description": "The role of transplant centres and healthcare workers in providing dedicated services to support the ongoing care of AYA recipients is therefore crucial in transition phases (Ullrich et al., 2004). Transplant centres provide follow-up care and monitoring and offer a range of support services, including counselling, education, and resources to help patients and their families navigate the transplant process and adjust to life post-transplant. However, there is minimal literature of transplant centre impact on the transition period for AYA solid-organ recipients and there is a lack of uniformity of programs and resources for pre- and post-transplant care of AYA’s in Australia and New Zealand.  To gain a better understanding of existing services, practices, protocols and support structures in transplant centres in Australia and New Zealand, we propose an exploratory survey of healthcare providers who provide transplantation services for solid organ transplant recipients in Australia and New Zealand. It is hoped that these results will identify areas of strength and gaps in services that can be targeted to improve the services and outcomes for AYA solid organ transplant recipients.",

  "description": "Globally, health services are experiencing shortages of midwifery professionals. Similar to other international and national jurisdictions, Western Australia (WA) is grappling with shortages in the midwifery workforce exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, strict border closures and midwives leaving profession. To promote the growth and sustainability of the midwifery workforce, the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Office has partnered with The University of Notre Dame to establish a pilot ‘Paid Employment Model’ for midwifery students. This model supports Registered Nurses to undertake a Diploma of Midwifery while retaining paid part-time employment within a WA HSP. It is envisaged that this model will attract and retain midwifery students who are then employed as professional midwives after graduation. WA Health has funded 60 students, 40 in WACHS and 20 in metropolitan settings, to undertake the pilot program along with six clinical facilitators to provide on-site support. This project aims to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, impact and economic benefit of the Paid Employment Model for midwifery students.",

  "description": "Despite advances in cancer treatments and increased survival of advanced melanoma patients, most patients with advanced melanoma will still die when treated with routine immunotherapies due to immune evasive mechanisms[1]. The personalised immunotherapy program will, instead, ensure each patient’s cancer is screened for genetic and immune profiles to identify patients unlikely to benefit from standard therapies. These patients will then be assigned a novel clinical trial agent most likely to cure them based on the presence of the drug targets in the patient's tumour. It is anticipated that selecting treatments for patients, based on the presence of specific drug targets in the patient’s cancer, will improve cancer outcomes and increase the survival of people with cancer. \n\nThis project aims to optimise the multiplex immunohistochemistry staining panel that can be used to rapidly identify the profile of immune checkpoint targets in melanoma biopsies. Further, the project aims to elucidate the accuracy of the artificial intelligence (AI) program to correctly identity fluorescent threshold for immune marker positivity. \n\nThis project will accurately and cost effectively fast track patient assessment for immunotherapy treatments; thereby rapidly matching patients with effective therapies to increase the overall cure rate of advanced cancers.",

  "description": "The highly variable clinical outcomes have made it difficult to identify the precise mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and thus the development of a specific cure or treatment to halt and reverse the inexorable decline in patient health. Chronic inflammation is a cardinal feature of IPF and is driven by both innate and adaptive immune responses. We recently demonstrated a potential role for antibody secreting plasma B cells (PCs) in the development of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Human studies also showed both elevated serum autoantibodies and elevated numbers of antibody secreting cells in IPF blood, and the accumulation of mature PCs adjacent to areas of active lung fibrosis in IPF lung tissue, supporting a functional role for PCs in IPF pathogenesis. We have used a multi-omics approach to examine the B cell repertoire of a subset of IPF patients and age-matched controls as well as screening IPF patient sera against a proteomic array to identify potential human autoantigens. We have shown that the B cell repertoire in IPF differs to that of control patients, with IPF patients displaying a restricted antibody repertoire compared to controls and evidence of B cell clonal expansion. We have identified a range of novel autoantigens in a subset of IPF patients. These findings suggest an approach for stratifying IPF patients based on an autoimmune phenotype that may inform treatment options for some of these patients. The UNFOLD study investigates the potential of immunotherapy for this chronic lung disease and specifically will 1) Validate specific common autoantigens using larger, geographically disparate IPF patient cohorts. 2) develop more appropriate and sensitive screening assays for early diagnosis and stratification to identify autoimmune IPF patients and 3). Test the suitability of novel plasma cell-specific B cell ablation and CAR-T cell therapy approaches in pre-clinical models of lung fibrosis.",

  "description": "This project seeks to explore the pedagogical implementation of the Spiritual Capabilities Framework (SCF) as experienced by early years educators. Since 2022, the researchers have worked with MercyCare to provide professional learning to educators on spirituality for young children. A SCF was developed that built on the researchers’ prior work along with the work undertaken with MercyCare. The SCF aims to provide a resource for professionals working with young children seeking to intentionally promote young children’s spirituality as part of their holistic development. This is the first Framework of its kind and as such, understanding the way educators make use of the Framework, and how they come to understand and promote children’s spirituality from its adoption, will be innovative, providing new knowledge in this field. The findings will be impactful for MercyCare specifically, but for the early years sector more broadly as they seek to invest in programs and approaches that assist educators in delivering quality early learning experiences.",

  "description": "Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks' gestation, poses significant risks to neonatal health and can lead to long-term consequences. Cervical shortening is a common precursor to preterm birth, and prevents the mechanical reinforcement of the cervix, in maintaining the pregnancy. Topical vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage are medical interventions aimed at prolonging gestation and reducing preterm birth rates. While cerclage is more effective in extreme cases of shortening (<10mm), combining progesterone with cerclage shows promise in moderately shortened cervixes (25-10mm). This prospective pilot study seeks to assess the efficacy of this combined approach in increasing gestational age and minimising neonatal complications.",

In 1983, the Burke government commissioned the inquiry in an attempt to fulfill their election promise on land rights, appointing Justice Paul Seaman to find the best form of land rights for Western Australia. The inquiry emerged at a time of growing unrest and land rights activism among Aboriginal people, particularly in WA with the steady encroach of mining in the north-west, and creation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976/77, that was passed by the Liberal Federal Government. Several hundred submissions were received from many sectors of WA society and more broadly.  These included Aboriginal organisations, the resource industry, pastoralists and graziers, community groups, academics, and lawyers. \nTo date, limited to no historical research has been conducted on this project. This project seeks to place this Aboriginal Land Inquiry in its full historical context, including the fact that land – who owns it, and who has access to it – is at the core of settler-colonialism. This inquiry was the first time Indigenous communities had been asked about their vision for the future. This project seeks to recover their forgotten voices.",

  "description": "This proposed research is rooted in a feminist phenomenological approach, offering a nuanced understanding of midwives' experiences with gender-neutral language. By prioritising midwives' voices and narratives via semi structured interviews, it proposes to uncover the hidden power dynamics and normative influences. This proposed study aligns with feminist principles and the pursuit of true gender equality, shedding light on the complexities surrounding gender-neutral language. This research offers a unique opportunity to understand midwives' perspectives on using gender-neutral language, inform policies and provide guidance to promote inclusivity. Using a phenomenological approach with semi-structured interviews aims to foster a more participatory and respectful engagement with midwife participants, reinforcing trust and candid sharing of experiences.",

  "description": "There is a growing global demand to approach maternal healthcare in a more woman-centred, culturally sensitive, and humanised way (16). A national survey from Australia indicates that around half of all women giving birth experience some level of birth trauma within the maternity system, and that 85% of women would make different choices for their next birth (17). A humanised approach to maternal health care not only addresses the physical needs of mothers but also prioritises their mental, emotional, and social well-being. The evidence demonstrates that such approaches lead to better health outcomes, higher satisfaction, and reduced disparities, making it a beneficial model for maternal health care (18,19, 20, 21). Acupuncture supports humanised holistic care by providing personalised, integrative, and culturally sensitive treatments that address the mind-body connection, and thus, can play a supportive role in maternity care (22). Acupuncture’s ability to reduce stress, improve mental health (23,24, 25) and manage pain (26, 27) aligns well with the principles of holistic and humanised care and highlights acupuncture's role in enhancing patient-centred, comprehensive health care (28). \nAcupuncture services are not new to BC Women's Hospital, as acupuncture has been offered at the ‘Families In Recovery’ (FIR) Unit for 2.5 years, and is the most requested and utilised allied health service on the unit. Verbal feedback from the FIR unit's patients suggest that acupuncture significantly improved conditions such as mental health, sleep quality, stress levels, and other concerns. However, no formal evaluation of the service offered at FIR has occurred. Because of the noted success in the FIR unit, a pilot\nprogram to expand to the antenatal unit (Evergreen) and the Reproductive Mental Health outpatient unit was created. This study, which evaluates this service, will be conducted at BC Women's antenatal unit, Evergreen, to examine what conditions acupuncture is most commonly requested for, and to examine its benefits or harms. The findings will help determine whether acupuncture positively supports clinical practice and if the services should be continued or expanded.",

  "description": "The average age of residents within Australian aged care facilities is 86 years old, comprising of 50% men and 50% women. This research project is focused on the aged care residents of the three Mission Australia aged care facilities, of which service a unique population. The people Mission Australia supports experience significant disadvantages such as physical or mental health concerns, and do not have a safe place to call home. As such, the age range in these sites is much younger, from 50-90 years old, and the gender breakdown is more male dominated, with 75% males and 25% females. Therefore, standardized aged care leisure and lifestyle applications may not be as relevant to these sites and this survey, which the government requires to be undertaken, will allow tailored consumer-centred care. The aim of our project is to analyse and compare the offerings leisure and lifestyle of rural and metropolitan Mission Australia Aged Care facilities and to facilitate more meaningful activities. The study objective is to ensure the leisure and lifestyle services provided to consumers at Mission Australia Aged Care sites are appropriate and relatable to them, as well as find aspects that need improvement.",

Paediatric burn patients have an increased long-term risk of a variety of serious health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infectious disease, mental health conditions and cancer (1-6). Chronic inflammation and sustained changes to the immune system after a burn may be related to the increase in morbidities seen in this population regardless of burn size and scar outcome (7, 8).\nPsychologically, poor mental health outcomes are more likely in a child who has been hospitalised for a burn injury compared to a peer who has not had a burn, and this remains true regardless of burn size, severity, and scar outcome. Psychosocial screening of patients and parents postburn might help us to understand baseline indicators of poor longer-term mental health recovery.\nPhysically, adults who have had a burn injury participate less in leisure-related physical activity (9), and have lower physical fitness (10). Paediatric burn patients might also have lower physical activity levels and impaired fitness resulting from physical and physiological limitations imposed by the burn, psychological limitations of the patient, overprotectiveness of the parent, or due to comorbidities secondary to burn.",

No existing studies of this context have been found and the findings should inform and enrich understanding of and support for these students. Students will discuss their experiences in focus groups during their first semester and data will be transcribed and analysed qualitatively in order to identify themes. Findings will be disseminated through presentations and publications within and outside the university. This is NOT associated with a specific Faculty or School, so please ignore the fields below, which were compulsory, but did not include Student Experience as a unit involved in research.",

  "description": "This descriptive study will examine an existing data set from a national survey of women who enrolled in the Australian National Diabetes Services Scheme and completed the ‘GDM Holistic Healthcare Needs Scale’.  This study seeks to further examine existing data from the scale evaluation which was conducted by the University of Canberra in collaboration with Diabetes Australia. This study will examine the same dataset to evaluate differences in the care needs of women living with GDM across different levels of geographical remoteness. This project seeks to develop a greater understanding of the holistic healthcare needs of women with GDM, including the impact of geographical remoteness and locality size, in order to improve GDM models of care across Australia. Comparative descriptive analysis of the dataset will use a non-parametric statistical test to compare the results of women based on their recorded postcode and corresponding class of remoteness according to the Modified Monash Model (MMM) for remoteness.",

  "description": "When Teacher Librarians (TLs) successfully collaborate with Classroom Teachers (CTs), the TLs’ knowledge and expertise are fully utilised, leading to improved student achievement (Lance et al., 2010; Lance & Kachel, 2018). However, in some schools, TLs are underused, and there is limited collaboration between teacher librarians and classroom teachers (Cooper & Bray, 2011; Wersebe, 2018). This research seeks to identify the challenges and opportunities of collaboration as perceived by TLs, CTs, and principals in Australian primary schools. This research undertakes three studies. Study 1 is a systematic scoping review of existing literature to understand the role of TLs in Australian primary schools. The scoping review will inform the design of a new model that demonstrates collaborative practices among TLs, CTs, and principals as they teach students to be digitally and information literate in the modern world. In Study 2, data will be collected through an online survey, where participants will be asked to define collaboration and the role of the TL, as well as to reflect on their current experiences and explain what TL-CT collaboration looks like in practice. Study 3 will involve qualitative, semi-structured interviews with TLs, CTs, and principals to gain deeper insights into collaboration, including the perceived challenges that hinder progress and the ideal conditions that support successful collaboration. This study aims to enhance educators’ understanding of what constitutes successful collaboration by providing solutions and future recommendations for TLs, CTs, and principals to strengthen partnerships within schools, along with guidance on their roles in TL-CT collaboration. This proposed PhD by publication aims to produce at least three papers, each derived from the three outlined studies, in an ongoing manner.",

  "description": "The research question associated with this project is “Can reliability and validity be established for testing protocols of the calf muscle that aim to closely replicate the functional demands placed on the calf muscle complex during running and field-based sports? The aims of this project are: 1. To develop a testing battery that assesses MVIC force outputs of the calf in both a vertical and horizontal plane, in a multi-joint position that replicates running demands. a. To assess ground reaction forces in the horizontal and vertical planes during a common calf rehabilitative exercise. 2. To establish the reliability of an isometric and dynamic assessment of calf muscle function. 3. To establish the validity of an isometric and dynamic assessment of calf muscle function. The insights from the MVIC testing battery and rehabilitative exercise performance have the potential to detect athletes at risk of CMSI and to improve rehabilitative practices following CMSI.",

Furthermore, from those with an ICH on brain CT scan, it is hypothesised that the vast majority will not have a neurosurgical/other intervention that varies from the conservative management for ICH.",

  "description": "Emergency departments (EDs) are crucial to the Australian health care system and the demand on them is increasing with nine million presentations to Australian public hospital ED’s in 2023-24. In addition, the wait times to see an ED physician or General Practitioner are increasing and this leads to extra pressure placed on emergency nurses, along with frustrated patients, which may lead to increased violence and aggression in the ED. \nBurn-out is becoming a worrying concern amongst ED nurses. The occupational stressors such as excessive workload, violence and aggression, and staff shortages are placing increased pressure on nurses, which is affecting nurses’ well-being and attrition. The increasing number of ED nurses leaving their job, and the nursing profession is concerning, therefore it is important to understand the stressors and employ strategies to protect these nurses from burn-out, which will may lead to improved retention and improved patient outcomes.",

  "description": "Burns are one of the most common forms of traumatic injuries globally, and are\nattributed to longer stays in hospital, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU), compared to\nother injuries. Burn pathophysiology is complex, consisting of multiple phases of disordered\nmetabolism that contribute to the challenge of burn treatment and management.\nWhile there are studies in the published literature that provide evidence for the benefits\nof early excision and grafting of burn wounds, there is still no consensus for the optimal timing\nto burn surgery for adult patients, in terms of what is early and how to translate earlier surgery\ninto practise.\nUsing data collected in the Western Australian Burn Clinical Data Registry since 2004,\nthis retrospective cohort study aims to explore this gap in the literature. From a sample\npopulation consisting of patients that underwent surgery for their burn injuries, patients will be\ncategorised into cohorts (<48 hours, 48 hours to 5 days, and >5 days) derived from the time\nbetween burn diagnosis and burn surgery. The associations between time to surgery and\nvariables including length of hospital stay (LOS), duration of care, hospital-acquired\ncomplications (HACs) and in-hospital intervention will be statistically analysed for\nsignificance.\nThe results of this study aim to better inform surgical management of burns in an acute\nsetting. By potentially providing evidence for improved outcomes, these results will clarify the\noptimal timing of burn surgery for better short-term post-operative outcomes.",

The aim of this study will be fourfold. First, to explore the beliefs, perspectives and practices of early childhood (EC) teachers who identify as being play-based in their approach to teaching and learning and consider how these beliefs are reflected in the environment, early childhood curriculum, teaching pedagogies and learning experiences employed in PP-Yr1. Second, to investigate the beliefs and practices of children towards play and play-based teaching and learning. Third, to explore the beliefs and perspectives of parents towards play and play-based teaching and learning. Finally, the research will aim to provide an in-depth account of the actual affordances and hindrances to play and implementing a play-based approach during these critical EC years in WA.",

Secondarily, this study seeks to better understand what spiritual practices patients would like to have in their lives but currently do not.  Thirdly, we seek correlations between patient/carer coping, quality of life and subjective spirituality and practices of rituals that are personally or culturally meaningful activities.",

  "description": "This mixed-method explanatory sequential research will recruit registered nurses via social media sites to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that promote post traumatic growth. The aim is to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors that support nurses following crisis. \n A validated instrument the Post Traumatic Growth Inventory, will be used in the quantitative phase to measure Personal Strength, Spiritual Change, New Possibilities, Appreciation of Life and Relation to others. The qualitative phase will comprise focus groups from the sub-disciplines of nurses: academics; clinicians; researchers; and managers and will explore intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to growth. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse quantitative data and thematic analysis will be used for qualitative data. The team comprises nurses from academia, research, clinical and management. \nProf Betihavas who is the CI on this project has experience researching post traumatic growth as an investigator within national and international research teams.",

The outcomes of this investigation will show whether it is possible to detect changes in albumin, which is the most abundant protein in human blood, as a result of the IPC protocol and subsequent exercise.",

Co-researchers will include people who are (or have been) involved in the on-Country immersions, including judicial representatives, on-Country hosts, facilitators and interpreters. An Aboriginal Reference Group will oversee the cultural aspects of the research. Methods include one-on-one interviews, courtroom observations, and analysis of court documents. The co-researchers in the PAR will use the findings to inform the design, delivery and evaluation of future programs; develop a 'Theory of change for two-way learning'; and create a framework to inform future evaluations of on-Country programs. The project ultimately aims to build towards a more culturally-safe court environment for Aboriginal people in Western Australia’s criminal justice system.",

The objectives are (1) to explore GP’s preferences and expectations regarding communication from pharmacists in terms of asthma and COPD management, (2) to assess challenges and barriers that GPs encounter secondary to the current lack of a systematic communication strategy around GPs and pharmacists, (3) to identify enablers that support interprofessional collaboration from the insights of GPs, and (4) to identify recommendations for GPs-pharmacists communication strategies aligned with the existing GPs’ electronic medical record (eMR)and clinical workflows.",

The data is categorised yearly participation rates from Swimming Western Australia (WA), Athletics West. As well as the impact the Olympics has on Independent schools participation in swimming and athletics. These results indicate that there is a four-year cycle impacting sporting clubs’ for both swimming and athletics participation. Likewise there is a  correlation impacting positively on Independent schools. This study also serves as a guide to make recommendations that schools consider adapting programs with the potential to see greater participation co-synced with the four year Olympics cycle.",

  "description": "Australia has among the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world; two out of three people in Australia will have some form of skin cancer by age 70. Those living in regional and rural areas have a higher incidence of skin cancer than their metropolitan counterparts, and yet, the reach of skin cancer services to regional, rural, and remote Australia is limited to non-existent. General Practitioners (GPs) are primarily responsible for opportunistic skin cancer detection, often made difficult by constrains on consult times, further exacerbated by the maldistribution of primary care providers in rural areas. One solution may be to better utilise nurses as primary providers of skin checks in collaboration with these GPs. This study will examine the barriers and enablers of nurse-led skin checks in rural Australia. Semi-structured interviews will be used to assess the perceived barriers and enablers to a nurse-led screening model, from the perspective of the practitioners who deliver these services. If successful, this project will highlight how to improve future implementation of a nurse-led screening model, and better position future skin screening methods for uptake in rural communities.",

Specifically, it aims to evaluate the preparedness of the Australian nursing workforce to address these opportunities. It aims to test the hypothesis that \" the existing nursing education programs in Australia are not sufficient to equip graduates for effective job readiness in the primary care environment.\" This will be done by an analysis of  training nursing curricula and then a comparison made  between skills taught and those required to work in General Practice  and Primary Care nursing.",
