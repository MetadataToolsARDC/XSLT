  "description": "This project is a three-year investment to develop guiding principles and frameworks to help governments, civil society and communities undertake best practices in adaptation. It supports the NESP Climate Adaptation Initiative to answer important questions about how Australia is adapting to climate change. \nIn a changing climate, adaptation is crucial for the well-being and prosperity of all Australians. Supported by solid decision-making frameworks, successful adaptation is built from the best available science and evidence.\nGovernments and organisations are increasingly considering future climate risks as part of the adaptation planning and implementation processes. To guide best practice and form a national picture of what works well, there is much to learn from plans and action already in progress.\nThis project has explored ‘enablers’ of adaptation to understand how adaptation practitioners can help overcome barriers they face. It has also developed guiding principles on what best practice adaptation looks like. \nIn 2025 we released the Australian Adaptation Database, Australia’s first national climate change adaptation stocktake. The Australian Adaptation Database is helping to understand Australia’s progress toward climate change adaptation, collecting and categorising a sample of adaptation activities happening across different scales, sectors and geographic locations.

  "description": "The Queensland Threatened Lizard Survey (2021–2026) conducted surveys and fieldwork on the eleven species of threatened squamate (lizard and snake) in Queensland. This resulted in the rediscovery of Lyon’s grassland striped skink, which had not been seen since 1981 (42 years). The surveys also found a new site for the McIlwraith Range leaf-tailed gecko, which was formerly known from a handful of sightings at one site.\n\nImportantly, the surveys for seven other threatened Queensland squamate species resulted in improved knowledge of the distribution of these species and the threats that they face. The survey work did not detect either the Fassifern blind snake (not seen since 1992) or the Gravel-downs Ctenotus (not recorded since 1984). Overall, this project has improved our knowledge of the conservation status of the most imperilled squamate species in Queensland. \n\nThe research built on the findings of a [comprehensive review of the conservation status of Australian lizards and snakes carried out in 2017](https://ebooks.publish.csiro.au/content/action-plan-australian-lizards-and-snakes-2017), and a project to [identify the reptile species most at risk of extinction](https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/pc20033) over the next 20 years.

  "description": "When Teacher Librarians (TLs) successfully collaborate with Classroom Teachers (CTs), the TLs’ knowledge and expertise are fully utilised, leading to improved student achievement (Lance et al., 2010; Lance & Kachel, 2018). However, in some schools, TLs are underused, and there is limited collaboration between teacher librarians and classroom teachers (Cooper & Bray, 2011; Wersebe, 2018). This research seeks to identify the challenges and opportunities of collaboration as perceived by TLs, CTs, and principals in Australian primary schools. This research undertakes three studies. Study 1 is a systematic scoping review of existing literature to understand the role of TLs in Australian primary schools. The scoping review will inform the design of a new model that demonstrates collaborative practices among TLs, CTs, and principals as they teach students to be digitally and information literate in the modern world. In Study 2, data will be collected through an online survey, where participants will be asked to define collaboration and the role of the TL, as well as to reflect on their current experiences and explain what TL-CT collaboration looks like in practice. Study 3 will involve qualitative, semi-structured interviews with TLs, CTs, and principals to gain deeper insights into collaboration, including the perceived challenges that hinder progress and the ideal conditions that support successful collaboration. This study aims to enhance educators’ understanding of what constitutes successful collaboration by providing solutions and future recommendations for TLs, CTs, and principals to strengthen partnerships within schools, along with guidance on their roles in TL-CT collaboration. This proposed PhD by publication aims to produce at least three papers, each derived from the three outlined studies, in an ongoing manner.",

  "description": "Southern right whales are listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act and are a species of national conservation significance. Monitoring of their recovery is guided by the *Southern Right Whale Conservation Management Plan*, which aims to improve the population’s conservation status through regular assessment of population size, calving intervals, and spatial trends.\n\nThis project continued the long-term aerial survey program of southern right whales along the southern Australian coast, spanning from Perth (WA) to Ceduna (SA). Annual surveys have been conducted since 1993, providing a continuous long-term dataset for the 'western' population and supporting national assessments of connectivity with the smaller ‘eastern’ population. The surveys contribute essential data on population trends, calving rates, and movements of individuals.\n\nThe August 2022 aerial survey ensured an uninterrupted time series in the long-term population trend data. This is particularly important given the species' non-annual breeding cycle (typically every three years). Annual surveys are essential to maintain an acceptable level of precision in estimating population trends and key life history parameters. A total of 526 whales were recorded, including 247 cow–calf pairs, 31 unaccompanied adults and one yearling. Based on long-term models, this equated to a population estimate of approximately 2,675 individuals, with an average annual growth rate of ~5.3%.\n\nWhile this represents a continued population growth, results suggest a possible slowing in the rate of growth over the past 13 years (from 7.5% in 2009). The 2022 survey also recorded the lowest number of unaccompanied animals in the entire time series, extending a five-year trend of low sightings in this group. Continued monitoring of the population is needed to assess whether these changes represent longer-term shifts in population dynamics and calving intervals, and to inform adaptive management for this long-lived, slow-recovering species.",

  "description": "The southern right whale (*Eubalaena australis*) is listed as Endangered under the *Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999* (EPBC Act) and is subject to conservation listings in five Australian states due to severe population declines caused by historical whaling. The Southern Right Whale Conservation Management Plan 2011–2021 outlines the current status of, and threats to, the southern right whale in Australian waters and prioritises recovery actions during this period. The long-term vision for the recovery of this species in Australian waters is to increase the population size to a level that the conservation status improves, and the species no longer qualifies for listing as threatened under any of the EPBC Act listing criteria. The plan must be periodically updated to reflect new knowledge and prioritise the research needed to monitor population recovery and predict the impacts of threats such as climate change.\n\nAerial surveys of southern right whales have been conducted across the southern Australian coast from Perth (WA) to Ceduna (SA) since 1993, as part of a long-term program to monitor the recovery, and inform the Conservation Management Plan (2011-2021), for this Endangered species. In Australia’s south-east, there has been little sign of recovery in southern right whale numbers following intense commercial whaling. A working hypothesis assumes separation between the ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ populations, largely due to loss of ‘cultural memory’ of whales migrating to the eastern range breeding areas. Given the relative paucity of animals that visit the southern Australian coast in areas other than south-west Australia, the western population is considered to represent the majority of the ‘Australian’ southern right whale population. The count data from these aerial surveys provide data on population trend and estimates of population size for the ‘western’ population, and hence the majority of the Australian southern right whales. Associated photo-identification data provide life history information (such as calving intervals) and connectivity between the ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ populations and contribute to the national southern right whale photo-id database: the Australasian Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalogue (ARWPIC).\n\nThe 2020 aerial survey program recorded substantially lower numbers of whales than in the previous 13 years, and the lowest number of non-calving whales since the program started. This project conducted new aerial surveying in August 2021 to provide a relative estimate of annual population size for determining longer term population trends and contribute to determining if 2020 was an anomalous year or an indicator of some longer-term change to recent recovery rates and the female breeding cycle.",

  "description": "Australia’s coastal floodplains and wetlands provide essential ecosystem services and have immense cultural value. They regulate water quality, moderate flood and storm damage, and provide habitat for marine life including commercial fish and shellfish species. These environments are threatened by accelerating rates of sea-level rise. A national approach is needed to monitor and assess the way coastal floodplains and wetlands are changing in response to sea level rise.\n\nA useful measure of resilience is the extent to which coastal wetland sediments can accrete vertically at a rate matching that of sea-level rise. Assessing the resilience, or vulnerability, of these environments requires measurements of rates of vertical accretion, subsidence and elevation gain across a range of coastal settings. The Surface Elevation Table-Marker Horizon (SET-MH) technique measures the vertical accretion of coastal wetland sediments. This enables assessment of whether wetlands are keeping pace with sea level rise (measured at tide gauges), or subsiding relative to local sea level rise and thus vulnerable to permanent inundation and loss.\n\nAustralia’s network of Surface Elevation Tables is one of the most extensive in the world, consisting of over 200 benchmark monitoring stations from Westernport Bay, Victoria to Darwin Harbour, NT. The network has developed largely without national coordination, and the data gathered have not been readily available to the research community or research users.\n\nThis project collated SET data on accretion, subsidence and elevation change in mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses and tidal freshwater forests, and provides an initial analysis of accretion and surface elevation trends. This information is vital to coastal risk assessment, estimating blue carbon sequestration, and modelling potential predicted changes in other ecosystem services.",

  "description": "Coastal and marine environments are increasingly exposed to pollution from land-based sources, including wastewater. With the majority of Australians living near the coast, household chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and plastics can enter the ocean via wastewater treatment plant outfalls. National policies and action plans, including Australia’s Waste Policy Action Plan, the Threat Abatement Plan for the impacts of marine debris, and the One Health Master Action Plan, all emphasise the need to incorporate emerging pollutants into contaminant guidelines. However, current monitoring programs focus on a limited set of contaminants, leaving major gaps in our understanding of the presence, concentration, and ecological effects of emerging pollutants in the marine environment.\n\nThis project addressed this problem by: (1) identifying priority pollutants of concern; (2) determining concentrations of Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CEC) at a range of wastewater outfall sites with varying hydrodynamic settings; and (3) assessing where environmental impacts are likely to be greatest. It focused on five key pollutant groups: microplastics, nutrients, heavy metals, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), and antimicrobials. Hydrodynamic modelling was used to evaluate residence times and pollutant dispersal in selected marine settings, and field sampling was conducted to assess contaminant levels and potential ecological impacts on the lower food web. The project built on the findings of NESP MaC [Scoping Study 1.16](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/1-16/), which identified the need for impact assessments for CECs.\n\nThe project generated new knowledge to inform risk assessments of emerging contaminants in the marine environment and provides recommendations for prioritising future monitoring and investment. It also enhances access to wastewater discharge data through continued development of the [National Outfall Database](https://nod.org.au/).",

  "description": "Australia’s network of Commonwealth Marine Parks plays a central role in conserving marine biodiversity, supporting sustainable use, and protecting cultural and recreational values. With over 60 parks spanning diverse habitats - from shallow coastal areas to deep offshore canyons - effective and adaptive management depends on access to reliable, fit-for-purpose data and data products that reflect the condition of park values and the pressures acting upon them.\n\nThis project improved the capacity to assess the effectiveness of Australian Marine Park (AMP) management by identifying and evaluating priority data and data products required for characterising marine systems and management effectiveness. It worked closely with Parks Australia to assess the availability, quality, and delivery mechanisms of existing datasets, and determined whether these were operationally viable, maintainable over time, and aligned with FAIR data principles. Technical assessments considered consistency of formats, use of standardised vocabularies, as well as machine-readability and the use of national standards for data and collection methodologies.\n\nUsing available data, knowledge, and existing data infrastructure, the project developed methods for estimating the condition of AMP values (excluding cultural values) and for assessing management effectiveness. Recommendations were provided to improve the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of priority data products through national platforms.\n\nOutcomes of the project include a clearer understanding of existing data gaps and a practical foundation for improving future AMP assessments. Parks Australia was equipped with a structured assessment of current data suitability and availability, a demonstration of condition estimation methods, and strategic recommendations to enhance data delivery and alignment with park management cycles. This work directly contributes to the Marine and Coastal Hub’s Protected Place Management Initiative and supports national efforts to build integrated data systems for marine estate monitoring and reporting.",

  "description": "Rocky reefs on Australia's temperate continental shelf support diverse ecological communities, including corals, sponges, mobile invertebrates, fish, and marine mammals. These habitats underpin important natural, economic, and cultural values and are subject to pressures from fishing, shipping, and climate change. Rocky reefs are key features of many Australian Marine Parks (AMPs), and improving knowledge of their extent and condition is essential for effective management and evaluation of conservation outcomes - particularly in offshore areas where seafloor habitat data is limited.\n\nThis project addressed knowledge gaps on the extent and distribution of seabed habitats by focusing on rocky reef systems within the South-west and South-east Marine Parks Networks. It built on previous research from the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub by collating and analysing existing seafloor data, and deploying drop cameras at priority sites (selected in consultation with Parks Australia and other end-users) to validate seafloor habitat extent and type. This new survey data was incorporated with newly developed data workflows to generate ecosystem models of reef and soft sediments, and broad-scale ecosystem classes - with a focus on workflows enabling rapid update of products and ensuring consistency across mapping outputs. These data products directly support NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project 2.3 ([Improving knowledge transfer for AMP management](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/2-3/)).\n\nThe project team worked with Indigenous Rangers and organisations in the South-west region to identify opportunities for collaboration, incorporate cultural knowledge into research design, and support knowledge exchange through field-based activities and on-country engagement. The project aimed to strengthen both established and emerging relationships, building on existing collaborations between University of Western Australia (UWA) researchers and the Esperance Tjaltjraak Native Title Aboriginal Corporation (ETNTAC) on complementary projects. UWA had also previously partnered with the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council (SWALSC), in consultation with the South West Boojarah (now Karri Karrak) and the Undalup Association, to support cultural mapping and biodiversity surveys under the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub. These partnerships informed the project’s cultural engagement approach and laid the groundwork for ongoing collaboration.\n\nOutcomes of this work included improved capacity for AMP managers to identify and monitor rocky reef habitats and key natural values, assess management effectiveness, and support initiatives such as marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based fisheries management, and contribute to emerging frameworks such as ocean accounting. It also helped to guide the targeting of future surveys, particularly in ecosystems with high conservation value.",

  "description": "Standardised approaches to marine monitoring are critical for ensuring data consistency, transparency, and comparability across time, regions, and sectors. The development and application of national standards and best practices provide the foundation for monitoring the condition of Australia’s marine estate. As pressures on the marine environment increase, so too does the need for robust, inclusive, and nationally consistent monitoring practices.\n\nThis project advanced the development and implementation of national best-practice standards to monitor the condition of priority values and pressures across Australia's marine estate. It built on previous work conducted by the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub through the release of Version 3 of the [*Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters*](https://marine-sampling-field-manual.github.io/). This version introduced three new manuals for: (1) sampling microplastics in marine and coastal environments; (2) conducting knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys with recreational marine users; and (3) use of the Benthic Observation Survey System (BOSS), a novel multi-camera drop platform for benthic imagery. Indigenous partners contributed to the development of the KAP and BOSS manuals, laying the foundation for future Indigenous-led monitoring initiatives.\n\nThe project identified key barriers to adoption of the field manuals and developed a set of recommendations, included nominating the manuals for international endorsement, establishing governance mechanisms, securing long-term funding, and identifying priorities for future SOP development, such as offshore renewable energy monitoring. All materials were aligned with the Ocean Best Practices System to facilitate national and international uptake.\n\nA practical implementation plan was developed to guide the future development and maintenance of national standards; promote their broader adoption; and assess their effectiveness and impact in delivering priority monitoring activities.",

  "description": "Plastic pollution is pervasive in coastal environments globally and in Australia. Due to their small size, microplastics (pieces <5mm) are readily ingested by marine organisms and potentially accumulate across food webs, raising concerns for biota, ecosystem services and human health. Yet, to define guidelines and support policy actions that curb microplastic pollution, managers and decision-makers lack clear, synthesised information on this multifaceted issue, including on occurrence, sources, and pathways of microplastics in coastal and marine environments.\n\nThis project synthesised current knowledge on microplastics in the coastal waters of South-Eastern Australia (South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales), identifying key gaps in data, monitoring, and risk assessment. A central output was a compiled database of existing microplastics studies across the study region. Through engagement with stakeholders from government, research, and industry, the project defined shared priorities and barriers to action. Three critical research needs were identified: (1) methodological harmonisation, (2) source and pathway identification, and (3) evidence of ecological risk. Together, the synthesis and stakeholder input set a clear direction for future coordinated research to enable evidence-based management of microplastic pollution across jurisdictions.\n\nThe work laid the foundation for the development of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for marine microplastics sampling, which was subsequently delivered through [NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project 2.2 ](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/2-2): chapter [*Marine sampling field manual for microplastics*](https://microplastics-field-manual.github.io) in [*Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters, Version 3*](https://marine-sampling-field-manual.github.io).",

  "description": "Marine and coastal wetlands provide extensive ecosystem services—protecting shorelines, improving water quality, supporting healthy fisheries, promoting tourism, storing carbon, and holding cultural significance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Like many wetlands around the world, Australian wetlands continue to be threatened, degraded, and lost due to climate change, development, and other human activities.\n\nTo support the Australian Government’s development of a national wetland inventory, this project assessed the current state of coastal wetland mapping across five key areas: seagrass, saltmarsh, intertidal macroalgae, shorebird habitat, and blue carbon. It identified major knowledge and inventory gaps through a combination of literature review and consultation with 73 end-users and experts, resulting in 25 targeted recommendations to guide future mapping and data integration.\n\nA summary of the status of mapping habitat attributes and ecosystem services such as blue carbon, coastal protection and shorebird habitat is available in the project's Final Technical Report. This report incudes recommendations to guide investment in high-demand areas and support nationally consistent wetland management and reporting to address key knowledge gaps.",

  "description": "Climate change and population growth are accelerating the need for diverse solutions to coastal protection. Traditionally, shorelines are armoured with conventional \"hard\" or \"grey\" engineering structures such as seawalls which are non-adaptive and come with significant economic, environmental and social costs. While hard structures will continue to have a place in coastal protection, alternative methods that are more sustainable and climate-resilient should be more broadly adopted into the future where appropriate.\n\nLiving shorelines harness natural ecosystems to reduce coastal erosion and flooding and provide co-benefits such as carbon sequestration. They may consist of dunes, wetlands and biogenic reefs: either alone (‘soft approach’) or in combination with hard structures (‘hybrid approach’). To date, nature-based solutions have been underutilised in Australia, due at least in part to decision-makers needing clearer guidelines for when a soft, hybrid or hard coastal defence approach is most appropriate. This resulted in the publication of a foundational guide (led by Morris and Swearer and delivered under [ESCC Hub Project 5.9: Natural habitats for coastal protection and carbon sequestration](https://nespclimate.com.au/natural-habitats-for-coastal-protection-and-carbon-sequestration-project-5-9)) to inform the national use of nature-based methods for coastal hazard risk reduction. In the process of producing these guidelines, the lack of a national inventory of coastal protection projects already using nature-based methods was identified by end-users as a priority to enable their wider adoption as an adaptation strategy in Australia.\n\nThis project generated an online inventory of all current and planned on-ground actions by coastal land managers that have implemented a nature-based solution (NBS) to mitigate coastal hazards. From this, the [\"Living Shorelines Australia\"](https://livingshorelines.com.au) database was created. This inventory is the first step in identifying best practice, which will inform the future development of detailed technical design guidelines for implementing different nature-based methods in Australia.",

  "description": "Coastal water quality is threatened by an increasing volume of chemicals produced and used in our modern lives. These chemicals are commonly incorporated into pharmaceuticals and household items, and subsequently discharged into coastal areas from a broad range of point sources. Recently emerging contaminants include a variety of chemical (e.g. heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, nutrients) and microbiological (e.g. pathogens, antibiotic resistant microbes) sources that are discharged in sewage, stormwater, estuarine flows and industrial wastes.\n\nFor many of these chemicals, our understanding of their environmental concentrations and biological effects is limited. When new scientific information emerges to suggest that a particular contaminant may be hazardous, this is refered to as a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC). There is limited data about the environmental occurrence and biological effects of CECs, but emerging research suggests they have the capacity to be toxic.\n\nWith an increasing list of CECs detected in the environment, important questions remain unanswered around which contaminants and scientific knowledge gaps should be prioritised. This desktop study engaged CEC stakeholders from academic research, government, water utilities, and non-government organisations to collaboratively identify priority CEC issues in Australia’s marine ecosystems. The project delivers a risk-based framework for future CEC research directions and water quality management priorities.",

  "description": "Australian sea lion populations have declined by more than 60% over the past four decades. Abundance and trends vary markedly across the species range, suggesting that localised risk profiles from threats - such as bycatch, marine pollution, and habitat degradation - vary at small spatial scales. Fine scale variation in habitat use is thought to underpin these differences, yet knowledge about Australian sea lion's dependency on key habitats and their vulnerability to human impacts is limited.\n\nThis project deployed compact animal-borne cameras with GPS and motion sensors on eight adult female sea lions at two key colonies: Seal Bay (Southern Kangaroo Island Marine Park) and Olive Island (Western Eyre Marine Park). The devices recorded nearly 80 hours of footage over 560 km of seabed, identifying six distinct benthic habitat types, including previously unmapped rocky reefs and kelp forests.\n\nThe footage was used to develop fine-scale habitat maps using machine learning models, providing a valuable baseline for assessing ecological value, foraging intensity, and the effectiveness of protected areas. This innovative approach complements traditional seafloor mapping and offers a scalable, cost-effective method for locating and monitoring critical habitats for endangered marine species.\n\nThe results directly inform recovery planning, fisheries management, marine park design, and the identification of Biologically Important Areas. Ongoing camera deployments at Seal Bay and new sites along the western Eyre Peninsula will improve understanding of sea lion colony-specific behaviours and contribute to long-term monitoring of habitat change, diet, and emerging threats.",

  "description": "Coastal habitat restoration is scaling up rapidly in Australia and covers a range of diverse ecosystems including oyster reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, kelp forests, and saltmarshes. While monitoring is commonly included in these projects, approaches are often uncoordinated, inconsistently funded, and rarely follow open science protocols.\n\nPrevious NESP-funded projects have advanced understanding of the ecology and service provision of threatened ecosystems and established targets for repair based on reference conditions (e.g. Marine Biodiversity Hub [Project B4](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-b4-underpinning-repair-and-conservation-australias-threatened-coastal-marine.html)). They also created a national database of marine and coastal restoration projects (Australian Coastal Restoration Network: [Project E5](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-e5-role-restoration-conserving-matters-national-environmental-significance.html)) and supported the development of monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement (MERI) systems across various sectors. Building on this foundation, the current project synthesised monitoring approaches across multiple habitat types by drawing on the collective expertise of Australian researchers. It also explored the integration of emerging technologies—such as automation, artificial intelligence, and eDNA—to improve monitoring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe primary output of this project is a coordinated, open-science monitoring framework that incorporates clearly defined restoration goals and a core set of universal variables. Developed through expert consultation, the framework supports consistent benchmarking across projects while accommodating habitat-specific and goal-driven metrics. The framework promotes data accessibility, standardised definitions, and the integration of new technologies to streamline the development of future restoration projects and maximise the value of restoration monitoring.",

  "description": "Recreational fishing is an important leisure activity in Australia that delivers important social and economic benefits to the community. As the largest and most widely dispersed natural resource-based recreational activity in the country, it is subject to management strategies including bag limits, quotas, and no-take zones. Given the prohibitive cost of deploying compliance officers to monitor Australia’s vast marine estate, strategies are needed to encourage voluntary compliance from fishers.\n\nThis project explored behavioural interventions to promote self-compliance among recreational fishers, focusing on no-take zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and two Commonwealth parks off Western Australia (Geographe and Two Rocks). The research distributed more than 800 online surveys, followed up by focus groups and analysis to examine how demographics, motivations and fishing patterns influence fishers' intentions to comply with zoning rules.\n\nSurvey insights were used to pilot a new targeted approach to awareness campaigns. Using behavioural segmentation, the project tailored messaging to specific audience types and tested these via GBRMPA social media channels. The project also examined perceptions of compliance visibility and found fishers were more likely to comply when uniformed officers were present and engaged directly at ramps or on water.\n\nThe project outcomes provide a foundation for evidence-based behavioural interventions and targeted communication campaigns. It delivers a proof of concept for scalable, audience-specific behaviour change approaches that can be refined, implemented, and evaluated in future research.",

  "description": "The system of marine parks that spans Australia’s Commonwealth waters is among the largest in the world. These parks play a major role in conserving marine life, supporting commercial and recreational activities, and protecting cultural values significant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Parks Australia has developed management plans for five regional Australian Marine Park (AMP) networks (North, North-west, South-west, South-east and Temperate East) and the Coral Sea Marine Park (CSMP). Under each management plan, a science plan sets priorities for monitoring and research to evaluate management effectiveness and identify opportunities for improvement. This prioritisation is vital given the limited knowledge across many AMPs, the technical challenges and high costs of science in remote areas, and the finite resources available for park management.\n\nBuilding on foundational work from the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub (projects [SS2](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-ss2-%E2%80%93-interpreting-pressure-profiles.html) and [D7](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-d7-%e2%80%93-supporting-monitoring-evaluation-reporting-and-improvement-system-australian.html)), this project delivered the scientific and technical advice needed to establish monitoring priorities for natural values and pressures across all AMP networks and the CSMP—completing a full national priority list for monitoring. It applied a nationally consistent four-step prioritisation framework that considered ecological importance, vulnerability to pressures, baseline data availability, and logistical feasibility. The project also updated the National Ecosystem model and Pressures & Activities datasets, conducted expert vulnerability assessments, and produced a Relative Cumulative Impact index. The combined research delivers a nationally accepted \"common language\" to describe natural values and pressures and a science-based method to derive monitoring priorities, aligned with the Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement (MERI) system—an adaptive management framework that is globally unique and a significant step towards adaptive, integrated, place-based management.\n\nKey outputs include a national database of environmental and human-use data for each management region and a refined list of monitoring priorities for each AMP Network and the CSMP. The findings highlight major knowledge gaps—particularly in the distribution of mesophotic and rariphotic reefs, intertidal ecosystems, and recreational fishing impacts—and provide guidance for improving baseline data and pressure assessments. The prioritisation framework and data products developed through this project can be re-generated over time alongside improvements in the evidence base and our understanding of how ecosystems respond to multi-sectoral activities to support continual improvement in iterative, evidence-based park management and environmental outcomes.",

  "description": "The Maugean skate (*Zearaja maugeana*) is listed as Endangered under Tasmania’s *Threatened Species Protection Act and the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999*. Its known population is small (~3,000 individuals, Macquarie Harbour, 2016) and highly restricted, having only been recorded in two isolated estuaries: Bathurst Harbour and Macquarie Harbour in south-western/western Tasmania. This constitutes one of the most limited distributions of any known extant elasmobranch.\n\nAlthough the skate was first discovered in Bathurst Harbour, most knowledge of the species stems from the Macquarie Harbour population. Only four individuals have been reported in Bathurst Harbour, with the last reported sighting in 1992. Environmental conditions in Macquarie Harbour have changed markedly since then due to anthropogenic activities in and around the estuary including historical mining, hydro-electric generation and alteration of natural river flows, and marine fish farming.\n\nPrevious research has shown clear signs of population stress and evidence of detrimental impacts of degraded environmental conditions on the Maugean Skate in Macquarie Harbour. Understanding the potential population status of the Maugean Skate in Bathurst Harbour will assist in determining conservation actions. This study used Environmental (e) DNA to determine the presence/absence of Maugean skate in Bathurst Harbour, strengthening the evidence base for effective conservation plans and specific recovery actions.",

  "description": "Resilient, productive and sustainable landscapes support Australia’s rich biodiversity and agricultural and tourism economies, and are central to every Australian’s identity and wellbeing.\n\nIndigenous Australians’ cultural practices have sustainably managed these landscapes for millennia. However, our rangelands, agricultural and peri-urban landscapes – and even our protected areas – face increasingly complex environmental challenges. These challenges erode landscape condition and undermine capacity to recover from threatening processes and extreme events.\n\nTo protect Australia’s landscapes and the services they provide, merely maintaining resilience will not be enough, particularly given the changing climate. Instead, we need to find new ways to enhance and restore resilience.\n\nEnvironmental research has played a critical role in articulating the key threats to the resilience of our landscapes by:\n\n- describing declines in landscape condition, species abundance and distributions\n- predicting future threats\n- proposing and prioritising actions that should be taken to address them.\n\nSuch research has been critical for raising awareness about the magnitude of the threats to biodiversity and the urgent need to address them.\n\nDespite progress on identifying and prioritising threats, surprisingly little research in ecology and environmental science has actually focused on solutions.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub’s research program is based on a proposed approach we are calling ‘solutions science’. This user-driven, solutions-focused, co-research model brings academic and non-academic partners together to address the scientific and societal challenges of strengthening and restoring resilience in Australia’s landscapes.\n\nThis project focuses on developing and testing better ways to do applied environmental science. This includes supporting the development and implementation of the core components of our solutions-science approach.",

  "description": "One of Australia’s key obligations under the Ramsar Convention is to maintain the ecological character of its internationally listed Ramsar wetlands, with these responsibilities shared by the Australian Government in partnership with state and territory governments and nongovernment site managers.\nAustralia’s 66 Ramsar wetlands cover more than 8.3 million hectares and exhibit a range of biophysical and ecological characteristics (DAWE, 2022). Each Ramsar wetland is essentially unique in the context of spatial and temporal pressures on ecological character. Appropriate monitoring, using context-specific indicators, is key to understanding changes in condition and ecological character of Ramsar sites in response to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. A well-designed monitoring program can provide critical information to enable site managers to adaptively manage and assess the effectiveness of management interventions and actions to restore and improve condition.\nGiven the specific spatial and temporal context of each Ramsar wetland, this project will develop a better understanding of the monitoring frameworks appropriate for use at Ramsar sites and identify current knowledge gaps to guide research and development of tools to build capacity to monitor and manage Ramsar wetlands.\n",

  "description": "Seabed and marine biodiversity data are time-consuming and costly to collect, so it is imperative that acquisition is focused on areas that align with end user priorities. The value that different stakeholders place on seabed and biodiversity data can be difficult to determine. Therefore, a shared process for identifying survey priorities is required to ensure the maximum shared benefit of future survey investment across research users, funding agencies, infrastructure providers, as well as the wider marine research community.\n\nThe project aimed to assist with the planning and prioritisation of marine surveys (both physical and biological) by scoping a prioritisation framework for marine surveys undertaking physical and biological seabed data collection in Australia. Focused workshops and targeted engagements with seabed mapping organisations were used to develop a standard set of metadata for agencies to define spatial Areas of Interest (AOI). The standard metadata were used in a prototype prioritisation framework that allows users to transparently and consistently rank and prioritise survey work or data delivery processes. The prioritisation is then based on rankings established by defined sets of criteria.\n\nA web-based AOI submission tool and mapping publication service was then developed for these defined areas as part of the AusSeabed Survey Coordination Tool. Adoption of this tool facilitates the development of an interim national areas of interest product to inform future survey planning. This product supports both the needs of Parks Australia's network Science Plans, and consideration of information needs for Indigenous Protected Areas within Sea Country.",

  "description": "Inventory surveys of Australian Marine Parks (AMPs) provide a broad description of the natural assets that exist in Commonwealth waters. These data can be further explored to identify biological indicators and metrics to cost-effectively monitor the AMPs and inform the AMP Monitoring Evaluation Reporting and Improvement (MERI) system.\n\nHistorical surveys conducted under the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub inventoried natural values and ecosystem components in selected AMPs. They developed and tested standardised survey techniques to allows scientists and park managers to identify and measure the status of natural values and ecosystem components. A recent Marine Biodiversity Hub survey conducted detailed bathymetric and visual sampling of key seafloor habitat and fish assemblages in the Capes region of South-west Corner Marine Park (Western Australia). \n\nThis project analysed the Capes survey data to characterise and predict the broader distribution of natural values and ecosystem features, and to identify relevant indicators of fish and benthic assemblages for Park management. The results are presented alongside summaries of existing knowledge on natural, socio-economic, and cultural values, as well as human pressures. Recommendations include establishing national and international monitoring benchmarks and incorporating survey guidance from Traditional Owners.\n",

  "description": "Effective management of natural resources and biodiversity requires an integrated understanding of the complex relationships between people and nature. This project reviewed a range of socio-ecological frameworks to identify which system components influence environmental outcomes, and which are most relevant for policy design and behaviour change. A key point of difference from previous NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub projects was an additional theme on implementation pathways, enabling research to inform the full progression from policy to on-ground action.\n\nThrough a co-design process with stakeholders, the project identified priority social and economic research needs and assessed the availability of relevant datasets to meet them. A key outcome was the identification of three common decision contexts faced by managers—monitoring, trade-off analysis, and promoting behaviour change—and the matching of appropriate frameworks and data to each context. The findings highlight critical data gaps, while providing practical guidance on how existing information can be strategically used to inform management and policy decisions.",

Appropriate monitoring approaches are required to provide baseline data and identify ongoing trends.\n\nMonitoring of environmental conditions and trends underpins policy and operational decision-making. Historically, monitoring required input by specialised personnel, making it costly and highly targeted.\n\nEmerging technologies are increasing opportunities for remote or passive monitoring and the recruitment of non-specialist input, including citizen science. However, the use of new technologies creates new challenges for the management of large volumes of monitoring data.\n\nThis project explores the application of new technologies to understand how to prioritise different monitoring tools and approaches, and integrate monitoring into broader management systems.

  "description": "Australia is home to more than 1,900 species and ecological communities that are listed as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). This number will increase significantly during the life of this second phase of the National Environmental Science Program (NESP), due to climate change and the 2019–20 bushfires.\n\nIn addition, there are more than 150 species – only some of which are listed as threatened – that are listed as migratory under the EPBC Act in response to Australia’s responsibilities under the global Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention) and several bilateral agreements. All these listed entities are deemed by the Australian Government to be matters of national environmental significance.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub has been charged with leading the cross-cutting ‘Threatened and migratory species and threatened ecological communities’ initiative to support policy development, program management and regulatory processes to protect Australia’s environmental assets in terrestrial, Ramsar and marine environments. This project will provide the research foundation for this initiative and will also identify projects that will be undertaken by the hub to address the cross-cutting initiatives coordinated by the other 3 NESP hubs.\n\n**NESP cross-cutting initiatives:**\n\n1. Threatened and migratory species and threatened ecological communities\n    - research relevant to the environmental assessment of development proposals affecting listed entities identified as high priority by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water\n    - monitoring and management of species and ecological communities after extreme weather events (in collaboration with the [Monitoring resilient landscapes project](https://nesplandscapes.edu.au/projects/nesp-2/monitoring-resilient-landscapes/)), including the evaluation of approaches to the biodiversity impacts of such events (in collaboration with the Marine and Coastal Hub and the Climate Systems Hub)\n    - coordinated regional approaches to the assessment, monitoring and management of listed entities\n2. Protected place management (led by the Marine and Coastal Hub)\n    - identify key drivers of resilient populations and ecosystems across protected areas\n    - inform the improvement of governance mechanisms for protected places\n3. Climate adaptation (led by the Climate Systems Hub)\n    - model the impacts of passing thresholds for species resilience or ecosystem transitions\n    - improve adaptation measures, including conservation introductions and habitat engineering\n    - identify climate adaptation information needs of land managers and communities\n4. Waste impact management (led by the Sustainable Communities and Waste Hub)\n    - understand the impact of waste and pollution on our natural ecosystems\n    - evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of chemicals and pollutants on terrestrial and freshwater ecological communities.",

  "description": "This project aims to identify practical solutions for catchment-scale restoration and threatened-species recovery in south-east Queensland (Qld). Recent extreme weather events (causing severe droughts, heat waves, wildfire and floods), habitat degradation and invasive species are posing increasing risks to the resilience and long-term persistence of highly valued and threatened freshwater species and the integrity of critical wetland habitats in the region. The project will focus on the Mary River (Moonaboola) catchment in Queensland – a hotspot of threatened freshwater and riparian species (including the Mary River turtle, Australian lungfish, giant barred frog and water mouse) that flows into the Ramsar-listed Great Sandy Strait, adjacent to the K’gari (Fraser Island) World Heritage area.\nBy working with local catchment natural-resource management (NRM) groups, Traditional Owners, governments and other stakeholders, this project will:\n• fill critical knowledge gaps on threatened species distributions and habitat requirements, ecological and cultural values, and threats\n• prioritise on-ground restoration actions to benefit multiple threatened species\n• undertake targeted implementation trials of habitat-restoration measures for key species\n• design a monitoring program to evaluate restoration success.\nThe project will deliver applied research outcomes to support ecosystem restoration after extreme events and planning for threatened-species recovery at national and state levels. The approaches developed and trialled in this project will be transferable to other catchments and threatened species. ",

Recent extreme weather events and associated catastrophic floods caused by Cyclone Jasper, ongoing habitat degradation and invasive species are posing increasing risks to freshwater fish and their critical wetland habitats in the region. Project activities include risk assessment and recovery planning through desktop reviews and expert workshops, as well as field surveys and laboratory studies in the high priority Bloomfield River. The project will involve scientific and community stakeholders from Universities, Government, NGO’s, NRM groups and Indigenous groups. The project will deliver applied research outcomes to support freshwater fish species management after extreme events and planning for rare and threatened species recovery at national and state levels. The approaches developed and trialled in this project will be transferable to other catchments and threatened species.

  "description": "This research project aims to improve the understanding and strategic management of the combined impacts of fire and drought in the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area (GBM WHA). The project will be co-designed with Traditional Owners, researchers, land managers and other research users to synergise perspectives, methods and research needs for this Priority Place. Our research efforts will focus on understanding where and under what circumstances parts of the landscape are buffered from over-exposure to fire and drought (i.e. ‘refugia’) and will also evaluate the broader ecological consequences of specific fire-management actions that are designed to conserve endemic/iconic taxa. Improving knowledge of the landscape processes that give rise to plant refugia and how management actions impact ecological integrity will help to refine current management practices, build in future landscape resilience, and provide tools and insights for the adaptive management approaches that will be required to improve the condition of the GBM WHA now and into the future.",

  "description": "More than half of the Australian land mass is now acknowledged to be part of the Indigenous estate through more than 450 Native Title determinations and over 1,230 registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements.\n\nThere is a fundamental need for better planning, prioritisation and evaluation to inform the management of this estate, while reconnecting and strengthening Indigenous peoples’ connections to their culture and their Country. This need is further strengthened by the fact that 54% of the National Reserve System is conferred through the Indigenous conservation estate in the form of Indigenous Protected Areas and jointly managed conservation reserves.\n\nThis Indigenous conservation estate supports a large number of Australia’s threatened species and their populations. Like other areas in Australia, the Indigenous estate is not immune to the major pressures that lead to ecosystem degradation and decline of biodiversity, including those impacting on threatened species and ecological communities.\n\nThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has tasked the hub with identifying, prioritising and undertaking the research required to support Indigenous knowledge, the management of the Indigenous estate and the mutual benefits this will deliver to the Australian environment.\n\nSimilarly, Indigenous Australians have identified and articulated a series of research needs, particularly for the management of Indigenous Protected Areas, in their response to the outcomes of the first phase of the National Environmental Science Program.\n\nThis project is co-designing projects that respond to these needs. This project also confirms an Indigenous voice in the governance and operations of the Resilient Landscapes Hub through the refinement and final endorsement of the Indigenous Partnerships Strategy.",

  "description": "Many challenges for resilient landscapes are attributable to people – but people are an essential part of solutions that strengthen and restore resilience. Good data and information are necessary but not sufficient on their own, as outcomes also depend on social and economic values, norms and behaviours. There is a need for socioeconomic research to better evaluate, plan and implement actions.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub has been tasked with addressing several socioeconomic research priorities which could help reduce the impacts of the multiple pressures on Australia’s ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nOne priority is to evaluate the success of different environmental plans, strategies or actions (such as offsets and biodiversity markets, regulations, and changes to curriculum through Education for Sustainability principles) on biodiversity outcomes. This evaluation may use methods such as environmental economic accounting or environmental valuation.\n\nA second area of priority relates to planning approaches. This involves designing systems to analyse cumulative impact and regional planning assessments. These can inform the design of policies and plans, including offsets policies, and may include information about environmental values, costs and benefits. Regional planning could include integrated, landscape-scale planning – including strengthening the links between research and regional natural resource management planning – and improved resilience planning, particularly in the context of a changing climate and multiple interacting threats.\n\nFinally, implementation focuses on the motivations, incentives, and organisational and societal norms that influence the extent to which environmental plans, policies and actions are able to change behaviours and generate positive on-ground environmental outcomes.",

  "description": "This research project aims to support the strategic management of Australia’s World-Heritage Gondwana Rainforests and Wet Tropics forests from the impacts of the invasive disease myrtle rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Austropuccinia psidii. Our research efforts will focus on understanding which ecosystem attributes increase the vulnerability of forests to myrtle rust and better understand the consequences of losing certain native tree and shrub species from forests. Understanding forest dynamics and the ecological role that different Myrtaceae species play in different forest types will focus future management and restoration efforts by setting the foundations for a myrtle rust susceptibility model aimed at guiding investment and fortifying biosecurity monitoring protocols.",

  "description": "This project aims to develop a climate change adaptation plan for focal threatened species and ecosystems of the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales (component 1) (already approved and underway) and the Wet Tropics of Queensland (component 2) (seeking approval for commencement 2025). \n\nComponent 1 Northern Rivers\nThe climate change adaptation plan will be designed to be embedded in planning and initiatives by local communities and governments. A bottom-up, community-based approach will be taken, working with local Landcare and species-monitoring groups, NSW North Coast Local Land Services (LLS) and Indigenous organisations. Our process will integrate with adaptation and resilience planning being undertaken by relevant local, state and federal government agencies.\nMany threatened species and several threatened ecological communities occur in the region. Significant wetlands, national parks, World Heritage areas, declared Aboriginal Areas, Indigenous Protected Areas and Indigenous Land Use Agreements are also found here. The region was home to the ‘Big Scrub’ subtropical rainforest, 75,000 ha of which was intensively cleared for agriculture. Less than 1% of this ecosystem remains. \nThe project will deliver applied research outcomes for stakeholders, including data, information and tools needed to support effective and appropriate adaptation actions for addressing climate-related risks to species and ecosystems in the region. The approaches and tools developed will be transferable to other regions.\n\nComponent 2 Wet Tropics\nThe same methodology will be used for a community-centred approach to climate change adaptation plan for focal threatened species and ecosystems developed for the Northern Rivers project. However, while the fundamentals of the methodology will remain the same, the approach will be modified to take into account the local contexts found in the Wet Tropics of Queensland; such modifications being co-developed with our partners, particularly WTMA, Terrain, FNQROC and the First Nations groups representing the twenty Rainforest Aboriginal Groups whose traditional lands fall within the Wet Tropics WHA. \nAs with Component 1 (Northern Rivers), this Wet Tropics component will deliver applied research outcomes for stakeholders and First Nations partners, including data, information and tools needed to support effective and appropriate adaptation actions for addressing climate-related risks to species and ecosystems in the region. Specific outputs and tools will be co-developed to ensure they complement existing resources and meet specific user needs.",

  "description": "The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) outlines key goals and targets that specifically acknowledge the importance of protecting, conserving and managing land and water effectively. While protected areas are well understood and studied, conserved and managed lands and their role in delivering environmental and social outcomes are not. To this end, ‘other effective area-based conservation measures’ (OECMs; termed ‘conserved areas’ in Target 3 of the GBF) will contribute alongside protected areas to meet area-based measures of 30% of land and sea by 2030. Similarly, managed areas which surround and connect protected and conserved areas are essential for meeting the broader goal that the integrity, connectivity and resilience of ecosystems are maintained and enhanced. Protected, conserved and managed areas will necessarily work in tandem to improve landscape-scale habitat quality and connectivity and, ultimately, overall persistence of biodiversity.\nThis project will review private-land conservation programs against the draft Australian OECM framework criteria to indicate the types of programs that are likely to qualify. Based on this review, programs that are near OECM standard but that fall short on key criteria, such as actively managing for biodiversity outcomes, will be considered for place-based research. Within programs, the research will design and deploy interventions to support landholders to manage their land consistent with OECM criteria and track the outcomes of this management over time to demonstrate enduring biodiversity outcomes. The research will demonstrate if the hypothesised benefits to both biodiversity and participants of these programs (e.g. increased nature connectedness) hold true. If our findings are positive, we expect these interventions could be added to private-land conservation programs in other jurisdictions.",

  "description": "This project aims to address two overarching research questions: how can First Nations Peoples knowledges be reflected within (or alongside) Ecosystem Accounts prepared following the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting—Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA)? and what are suitable methods for appropriately gathering and presenting First Nations Peoples’ knowledges in relation to SEEA EA?\nTo achieve the project aim, researchers will partner with two First Nations groups from contrasting contexts and environments (northern QLD savannah and southern WA coast). Together we will trial methods and prepare full sets of SEEA EA compliant accounts for each group. By co-designing methods and accounts presentation, the aim is for the accounts to provide information that is useful for the groups themselves in addition to providing useful information for other research users.\nBeyond accounts preparation, and incorporating existing Australian literature, the project will develop and test overarching learnings and recommendations that can inform future EA policy development within DCCEEW. Working closely with our First Nations partners, and testing outputs with a small number of First Nations people from other organisations, the project will seek to identify common themes across different First Nations groups, and assess the relevance of, and links between, national accounting information (such as NEAP) and accounts built upon First Nations knowledge and perspectives. The project is also linked with the Nature Repair Market team within DCCEEW and will exchange learnings and findings with those working in that space, thus seeking to promote complementarity between EA and Nature Repair Market developments.",

  "description": "Climate change and habitat loss pose significant threats to the fauna of Western Australia's southwest, a region recognized as a globally important biodiversity hotspot. Over recent decades, rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall, compounded by habitat loss, have led to numerous local extinctions. As climate change and habitat fragmentation continue to intensify, the risk of further extinctions grows.\nTo address these challenges, conservation landscape corridors have been proposed as an important solution. These corridors aim to enhance species dispersal by facilitating gene flow between fragmented fauna populations, thereby increasing their access to larger habitats and improving their resilience to climate change by boosting their adaptive capacity. However, ensuring these corridors achieve maximum effectiveness requires a strong understanding of where they are likely to be best positioned within the landscape, as well as the minimum habitat requirements for them to be effective for the species they are intended to support.\nOur research aims to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of existing landscape corridors within the megadiverse Fitz-Stirling region by conducting intensive surveys across multiple tenure types to inform habitat suitability models for a suite of target threatened species including chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), quokka (Setonix brachyurus), dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis), and malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata). Additionally, using reptiles as a surrogate for broader small vertebrate communities, we will use genetic data to map dispersal resistance across the broader landscape to identify optimal areas for future restoration. The combination of these approaches will allow us to determine how well current corridors facilitate species movement and gene flow while also guiding the strategic placement of new corridors and restoration efforts to maximize their impact on biodiversity conservation.",

  "description": "Peatlands in the Australian Alps face a range of threats; however, their remoteness and fragmented distribution makes ongoing condition assessment challenging. This project will assist in the management of alpine peatlands by developing tools for the assessment of peatland condition historically and into the future. To do this, we will integrate satellite remote sensed data with on-ground hydrological and floristic data, validated using higher resolution satellite and hyperspectral drone imaging to generate condition time series across broad regional areas. These tools will be affordable, simple to use and will allow land managers to assess peatland condition as and when required. (100/100). \nThe work directly addresses the national priority areas of ‘Soil and Water’ (new and integrated national observing systems) and ‘Environmental Change’ (predicting and measuring the impact of environmental change).",

  "description": "This project continues the Climate Systems Hub’s program of providing curated climate information and data from hub projects and other sources to support stakeholders’ decisionmaking and adaptation needs. Presently, very little information exists to assist managers of biodiversity adapt to climate change. At the same time, NESP projects are producing research, data and outputs that can be of assistance to land and sea managers responding to climate change.\nAn online adaptation decision support and knowledge platform will assist biodiversity managers as well as provide a platform for all four NESP hubs to house outputs relevant to climate adaptation for biodiversity. Through information synthesis, careful curation, codesign and collaboration with NESP projects, project 4.3 will build a climate adaptation knowledge platform for biodiversity.\nThe Resilient Landscape Hub has identified up to 17 projects that could be potentially linked and/or provide case studies for this project Adapt Land & Sea (i.e. formerly referred to as ‘ConservationAdapt’). This proposal is to contribute funds to develop written content for the web site/fact sheets for these relevant Resilient Landscape Hub projects and support the website development. ",

  "description": "Spectacled flying-foxes (SFFs) were listed as Endangered in 2019, following an extreme heatwave in 2018 that resulted in the death of approximately one-third of the population. The mass mortality of Australian flying-foxes at roosts during heatwaves has been well documented, with future extreme heat events considered the greatest threat to their survival. This project aims to improve our understanding of the local thermal environments of SFF roosts across their range, which is a critical aspect of their sensitivity to the increasing risks imposed by climate change. By doing so, this project will improve species management through the provision of tools to mitigate the devastating impacts of future extreme heatwaves and advise managers on effective interventions. This project addresses national priorities by providing adaptive solutions to support the recovery of a threatened species and in developing capacity to help reverse the decline in Australia’s natural environment.\n",

  "description": "To shift natural disaster management from ‘responding better’ to proactively preventing the worst outcomes, we will develop a culturally led framework for the identification and peer review of new, climate-targeted tools and strategies that will improve the resilience of our landscapes.\n\nPhase 1 of the project will focus on the development and refinement of a conceptual framework. The aim is to work with Traditional Owners – effectively and respectfully – to identify climate risks, impacts and observations on cultural and/or ecological values. We will then apply the Resist, Accept and Direct (RAD; Miller et al. 2007) approach to climate adaptation (if appropriate) to help develop the climate adaptation responses to specific landscape features or elements that are ecologically or culturally important. Traditional Owner led workshops will provide a culturally led priority list of issues of concern and gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed to respond to the likely impacts of climate change in a timely and effective way. The outputs of this phase (through reports and documents) will be a prioritised list of important cultural/ecological values that are at risk and in need of proactive strategies to build resilience across different ecosystem types. We will document how we use RAD to identify the type of climate adaptation response pathway that should be followed for each value and the concerns and gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. This will be used to frame the Phase 2 of the framework – ‘eco-thons’.\n\nPhase 2 of the conceptual framework is to take the prioritised list of values, and the kind of climate adaptation responses generated above to identify new ideas for solutions that could be refined and implemented as interventions on the ground. Each of the top 5 issues will be framed as a problem to workshop with specifically selected experts from a diversity of relevant fields in an eco-thon – a collaborative, environmentally focused, idea-generating workshop. The problem will be presented with the known gap and the parameters that must be met in order to be applicable on-ground. With representatives from First Nations people, scientists, engineers, conservators and farmers, these eco-thons will generate a broad range of potential management solutions and identify potential perverse outcomes. The output will be a peer-reviewed and prioritised (including benefits, costs, feasibility and risks) set of interventions ready to be implemented with some further testing of the strongest ideas, which is beyond the scope of this project. Traditional Owners will have right of veto of any idea through the process.\n\nPhase 3 of the project will review the conceptual framework and outline the lessons and recommendations of the process. This will be through evaluation by those who have participated in the first 2 phases of the project as well as independent evaluation by experts to make recommendations for refinement for future applications. The outcomes include application of this framework in real-world scenarios beyond this project.\n\nThis culturally led, evidence-based, transparent approach will raise awareness, enthusiasm and funding for the proactive measures that will be much needed in the coming years. The development and implementation of the identified tools and strategies are out of scope for this project.\n",

  "description": "Primary producers face increasing pressure from financial stakeholders, supply chains and consumers to demonstrate they farm sustainably to gain and maintain market access. A challenge is to identify management actions that can maintain or improve nature-positive outcomes without compromising farm production or profitability. Simultaneously, there are emerging opportunities for producers to diversify their income through nature markets. In collaboration with the CSIRO-led Ecological Knowledge Systems project, we will use stateand-transition models as a framework to integrate existing knowledge, expert elicitation and empirical data collection to test and validate the effectiveness of key interventions (reduced fertiliser application, strategic grazing) for improving biodiversity on ~10-15 farms in each of three geographic regions (Tasmanian Midlands, Western Victorian Volcanic Plains, Naracoorte Coastal Plain). The project will generate a stronger foundation for the sector to transition to a higher biodiversity future, inform opportunities to reduce input costs while maintaining productivity, and enable producers to leverage emerging nature markets, sustainability reporting and natural capital accounting.",

It will achieve this by undertaking 3 linked activities.\n• Activity 1: stakeholder workshop\n• Activity 2: examining methods used for restoration monitoring and evaluation\n• Activity 3: evaluating biodiversity outcomes of key restoration projects.\nThis research is foundational for enhancing biodiversity recovery, strengthening restoration program delivery, encouraging informed restoration investments, and meeting national environmental standards. It directly addresses knowledge gaps around restoration identified in the Australia State of the Environment 2021 report and current national priorities for biodiversity conservation and restoration.\nNote that this project is Phase 2 of the ‘Restoration by design’ project. Phase 1 is a small project currently underway (4.5 Phase 1: September 2023 – June 2024) which includes running a co-design workshop (planned for the first quarter of 2024) with a subset of stakeholders identified in this proposal. Project 4.5 Phase 1 is key to Project 4.5 Phase 2 of this project, as it is the formal start of the complex and time-consuming process of identification and consultation with stakeholders. Project 4.5 Phase 2 also aims to begin development of the program logic required for key parts of the project more broadly – specifically, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of restoration monitoring methods (there are many) and the inclusion/exclusion criteria for case studies to include in our detailed analysis here (again, there are many).",

  "description": "Island ecosystems around the world have been devasted by introduced species. Norfolk Island is no exception, with multiple species having been driven extinct, including birds such as the white-chested white-eye, Norfolk Island kaka and Tasman starling. Many other species face a similar fate if action is not taken. Rodents are a primary threat to many threatened plants and animals on Norfolk Island, including the Norfolk Island green parrot, a priority species under the Australian Government’s Threatened species action plan 2022–2032. We urgently need to fill critical knowledge gaps on the management of rats to allow us to move toward island restoration (‘rewilding’) before the ecosystem moves into an alternative stable state. Parks Australia needs to know how current rodent management activities are altering rodent abundance on the island. Results will be used to maximise the chances of local eradication to enable broader faunal restoration to begin.",

  "description": "Project summary\nFollowing discussions with Commonwealth and Regional research users, this project will include 4 major components:\n\n1 - Land managers from the Fitz-Stirling region in Western Australia require assistance to improve management of feral cats and red foxes.  The region has experienced researchers and managers, and collaboration with hub researchers will result in analysis and interpretation of existing data to inform future management. However, despite impressive local efforts to understand the ecology of invasive predators in the region, research users have identified opportunities for Hub research to build on existing knowledge to further mitigate the impacts of cats and red foxes on wildlife. Hub researchers will work with local research users to collect new data on target animals and incorporate these into practical recommendations for best-practice management (including monitoring) of feral cats and red foxes in the Fitz-Stirling Priority Place. This project will engage with and complement other work using existing cat-management data collected in the Fitz-Stirlings, and has been codesigned with end-users (WA DBCA and Bush Heritage).\n\n2 - The Commonwealth Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) and Saving Native Species (SNS) programs are exposed to significant risk from uncertainty related to the variable quality of feral cat and red fox monitoring program designs and the metrics they produce. This exemplifies an ongoing barrier to advancing feral cat and red fox management; ‘how do we monitor these species effectively?’ (this is a key issue in both the cat and fox threat abatement plans). This project will support NHT & SNS Service Providers and inform future management of the NHT program by investigating the statistical power of approved monitoring programs (Research questions: Can they detect what they want to detect; what is best practice monitoring of cats and foxes; how does this compare to what is currently being implemented at these sites; and is best practice monitoring cost effective?) and by operating three demonstration sites (Fitz-Stirlings, Kangaroo Island, Booderee NP) where ‘best practice’ monitoring will be implemented alongside existing monitoring programs, to contextualise typical monitoring outcomes (Research question: ‘What do monitoring metrics mean?’).  Guidance and training material on best practice monitoring and analysis will be a key output, alongside a shiny app that facilitates easy analysis of camera trap data using occupancy models. \n\n3 - Land managers on Kangaroo Island seek assistance in improving feral cat management in relation to leaky fences and understanding movements at low densities. An existing safe haven on Kangaroo Island is challenged with a leaky fence, providing the opportunity for Hub researchers to test the efficacy of sound-producing devices in keeping cats from breaching the fence. GPS telemetry will also improve our understanding of how cats traverse the landscape at low densities, which will assist with targeting management actions in these situations. \n\n4 - Synthesise our understanding of predator-prey interactions using the comprehensive datasets obtained from NESP projects in the Fitz-Stirlings, Uluru-Kata Tjuta, Kangaroo Island and Booderee National Park, as well as the information collected in sub-project 2. These sites have had extensive camera trapping occurring therein, which will yield information on presence and absence, that can be used in a multi-species occupancy modelling framework to determine the drivers of mesopredator interactions. This will provide evidence as to whether these interactions are driven by top-down or bottom-up factors. \n",

  "description": "This project aims to support water management that protects ecological and Indigenous values, undertaking targeted research on rivers in south-western Australia. Subject to further consultation, the study will assess the transferability of a hydro-socio-ecological model developed in northern Australia to systems in south-western Australia. The Donnelly River catchment has been identified as a priority system by Western Australian Government water managers and will be the initial focus area for research. Project outcomes will support watermanagement decisions to protect river flows for aquatic and riparian habitats that support 5 species listed in the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). Research will also address priorities identified in the 2020 Samuel review of the EPBC Act and the Productivity Commission’s 2020 National Water Reform inquiry, providing a framework for the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and cultural values in water planning.",

  "description": "The existing NESP project, Guiding the Strategic Management of Freshwater fish, was originally developed as a desktop project designed to use existing statewide datasets to then work with river managers to develop principles and approaches that can be used to manage and protect freshwater fish biodiversity in rivers and streams across Victoria. However, since the original project plan was developed, discussions with DEECA and others have led to a narrowing of focus to primarily consider threats to a small group of fishes that were once common in floodplain wetlands of the southern Murray-Darling Basin and more specifically in selected key Victorian catchments. A number of these species are now listed under National and/or State threatened species Legislation (including flathead galaxias, Murray hardyhead), while others (e.g. southern pygmy perch) have declined considerably in their distribution and abundance in recent decades and are increasingly being considered for listing Nationally in addition to existing State listings. Compared to riverine habitats, information on the status of wetland fish is comparatively sparse, and there has been limited research into, and investment in, strategies to restore local populations. Currently there is a tendency therefore to rely on restocking as the primary means for restoring local populations, but limited work to understand the success of restoration activities in the presence/absence of other management interventions. The revised project aims to fill this gap, and will generate information that will feed into regional and statewide management strategies. \nThe updated project goals remain consistent with those in the original plan, but with a much narrower geographic and habitat focus, and a more bottom-up approach, involving more on-ground sampling and greater engagement with local land-managers, including Traditional Owners. The project will synthesise existing data and knowledge about threatened floodplain species, their current distributions, current threats (including invasive species, wetland persistence, and their likely future distributions given threats they are facing now and into the future. We will also undertake a global assessment of the literature to assess the global trends in wetland restoration techniques and synthesis this information to provide advice to support the management of wetland habitats within Victoria and river-floodplain habitats more generally.\n",

  "description": "This project is using the western Cape York Peninsula and south-east Gulf of Carpentaria region as a case study to examine the relevance of existing risk-assessment frameworks and biodiversity maps for a regional approach to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).\n\nTo ensure biodiversity is protected, individual developments in northern Australia are currently assessed under the EPBC Act and other state planning legislation. However, there is a need to take a broader regional approach to assessing risks posed by the cumulative impacts of multiple developments.\n\nThe Cape York Peninsula and southern Gulf of Carpentaria region in Queensland is area of particular interest for future development. This includes proposals for mining, and water storage and extraction for irrigated agriculture. Each of these can impact water resources, biodiversity and culturally significant locations and values.\n\nAlthough the predicted impacts from individual developments may appear to be relatively minor, there is a risk that the ‘tyranny of small decisions’ could culminate in unexpected consequences for water quality, biodiversity and cultural values. This issue therefore provides a potential case study for an integrated, regional approach to identifying risks from development to environmental and cultural values.\n\nIn the first phase of the project, we are focusing on compiling information that can inform or be used in a future risk-assessment process. This includes collating tools, previous research outputs and a broad range of stakeholder perspectives so that the risk-assessment process is applicable across the study region and robust in a variety of situations. Additionally, we are examining current biodiversity maps, which are based on suitable habitats, to identify biodiversity hotspots, and compare these hotspots with potential water development areas.\n\nDuring the second phase we will work with a broader range of stakeholders to assess and refine the information collected in the first phase. Our team will then assess the information in the context of decadal patterns in water flows, possible future trends, and how these patterns might impact ecosystem productivity, health and cultural values over the long term.\n\nAs of October 2023, the project has been extended to include a third phase, where we will develop ecohydrological rules by integrating the research findings from phases 1 and 2, and studies in previous NESP and TRaCK projects, and others. This information will be used to inform water planning for the Gulf rivers. We will use new approaches for spatial mapping of water persistence into freely available models for water planning.\n\nThrough this project, we are providing information to improve outcomes for environmental and cultural values from the decision-making processes relevant to developments in the context of the EPBC Act and other risk-assessment schemes. We are also contributing to integrated planning and assessment work within an Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Environment Assessments Qld contract project and linking with the Marine and Coastal Hub’s project Supporting regional planning in northern Australia.",

  "description": "This project focuses on developing innovative tools using satellite imagery to map and monitor persistent pools (waterholes) within Australian rivers and floodplains. Persistent pools are vital water resources, especially under climate change and growing water use. They are crucial for ecosystems, providing habitats for species, sustaining ecological processes and serving as refuges during dry periods. The project will use satellite data from Landsat, Sentinel and Planetscope to map these pools, assess their dynamics, and predict future changes under various climate and water-use scenarios. The findings will support sustainable management strategies, including water allocation, climate adaptation and conservation efforts, with case studies in the Martuwarra Fitzroy River (WA), Gilbert River (Qld) and the Ovens River in Northern Victoria.\n\nPersistent pools are challenging to map due to their dynamic nature, shifting with changes in flow and precipitation. Current methods do not adequately capture these fluctuations, leading to potential underestimation of the area of persistent pools. The increasing demand for water resources, combined with climate change, underscores the need for better mapping and monitoring techniques. Remote sensing offers an efficient, cost-effective way to track these dynamic features across large areas, providing historical and real-time data to inform management decisions. This project aims to fill the gap in current methods by integrating data from multiple satellites and analysing the ecological and socio-cultural implications of pool dynamics.",

  "description": "This research project explores how Years 3–4 teachers in the Diocese of Sale Catholic Education Limited (DOSCEL) perceive Religious Education (RE) and the professional development (PD) and formation they receive or seek. While RE is central to the mission of Catholic education, many generalist primary teachers report feeling underprepared to teach it confidently and meaningfully. Using a qualitative phenomenological approach, this study will gather data through semi-structured interviews and narrative-style surveys. It aims to capture teachers’ lived experiences, highlight the challenges they face, and identify the kinds of PD and formation that would most support their RE teaching practice. The findings will offer insights into how diocesan policies and curriculum frameworks align with classroom realities, and will inform future development of RE-specific PD that is theologically grounded, practically relevant, and responsive to teacher needs. This research contributes to strengthening Catholic identity through more effective and supportive teacher formation.",

  "description": "The population of Southern Right Whales (SRW) in the Southern Hemisphere has been recovering slowly from near extinction due to its decimation from whaling before its ban in the mid-1970’s. The population that visits the Australian coast each year to breed is estimated to have increased by about 4–5% per year in the past two decades, bringing the total population to approximately 3,500 whales. As the population increases, the whales extend their breeding areas into previously occupied suitable habitat. As the species recovers, there is increasing evidence of expansion of aggregation areas. Consequently, there is a need to update known established aggregation areas and Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) and update relevant Marine Parks management plans based on new evidence.\n\nFlinders Bay and Geographe Bay off south-western Western Australia were likely to have been important calving areas before commercial whaling began. Much of this habitat is popular for recreational boating and other marine activities. This project collated and completed photo-ID matching of southern right whale images collected between 2010 to 2020 in the southwest of Australia, and uploaded these to the Australasian Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalogue (ARWPIC). The photo-ID matching outcomes provide evidence that Flinders Bay and Geographe Bay now fit the criteria to be recognised nationally as Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for Southern Right Whales.",

  "description": "Seagrasses provide resources and ecosystem services critical to the health of coastal ecosystems and human populations. They increase water clarity, stabilise sediments and reduce coastal erosion, sequester carbon, and provide habitat and food to marine animals, including commercially important fish and invertebrates. Across Australia, the loss of >275,000 ha of seagrass meadows and associated ecosystem services—valued at AU$ 5.3 billion—has contributed to the long-term degradation of estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. Restoration of seagrass is critical for improving the health and function of these ecosystems and sustaining coastal communities and industries that depend on them, yet restoration projects to date typically occur at small scales, driven by local priorities and with variable success.\n\nThis project addressed this problem by bringing together scientists and key stakeholders to collate knowledge on seagrass ecology and restoration, and generated a framework to scaling-up restoration nationally. A national workshop with experts identified a shortlist of drivers key to restoration success, including sediment dynamics, microbial communities, hydrodynamics, and species interactions. It highlighted the importance of incorporating seagrass genetics and life histories into site and donor material selection to improve long-term resilience. New technologies such as eDNA, automation, and AI were also assessed for their potential to improve monitoring and reduce costs, while standardised methodologies and molecular tools were recommended to track microbial indicators and site suitability. A key insight from the workshop was the central role of sediment processes in feedback loops that determine seagrass health—providing a foundation for more effective, scalable restoration strategies.\n\nOn-ground case studies were conducted in Western Australia and New South Wales to test the proposed restoration framework in collaboration with Indigenous and community partners: sediment quality assessment and manipulation (Gamay Rangers, UNSW); seed and seedling capture using sediment-filled hessian tubes (Malgana Rangers, UWA); and large-scale seed collection for seed-based restoration through the 'Seeds for Snapper' initiative (OzFish and UWA). These trials demonstrated the effectiveness of community-led restoration and reinforced the potential of seed-based methods for scaling up seagrass recovery.",

  "description": "The Great Southern Reef (GSR) is an 8,000 km network of temperate rocky reefs stretching from Western Australia to New South Wales. Dominated by kelp forests, it is one of the world’s most biodiverse and productive marine ecosystems, supporting important fisheries, tourism, cultural values, and ecological functions. Despite its significance, kelp forests are in decline due to ocean warming, marine heatwaves, pollution, and expanding herbivore populations—threatening both biodiversity and the services these reefs provide. Evidence-based management is hindered without accurate estimates of the GSR's contribution to society and the economy.\n\nThis project delivered the first systematic synthesis of existing data on the ecosystem services and economic value of the GSR, focusing on shallow reefs (0–50 m). Market and non-market services—such as commercial and recreational fishing, tourism, carbon sequestration, and existence value—were assessed for each state in which the GSR occurs. The synthesis highlighted the high societal dependence on the GSR, with over 17 million Australians living within 50 km of its waters and significant national engagement in related economic and cultural activities.\n\nAll data inventoried by the project were aligned with national and international environmental-economic accounting standards to support future inclusion in Australia’s ocean accounting frameworks. This inventory provides the foundation for developing a national ocean account for kelp forests, and identifies the key data gaps that must be addressed to fully capture the GSR’s value and guide long-term policy and investment.",

  "description": "Spotted Handfish (*Brachionichthys hirsutus*) were once common across the bays and estuaries of South-eastern Tasmania. By 1996, however, populations had declined and the species was listed as Critically Endangered under Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The species is relatively short-lived, (5–10 years) and matures at more than two years’ old. This leaves a short window for reproduction, which relies on egg masses laid on seafloor structures such as stalked ascidians. If spawning fails, population declines may occur rapidly. With no planktonic life stage to aid dispersal, and low adult dispersal, outside recruitment to re-establish collapsed populations is unlikely.\n\nAnalysis of 23 years of Spotted Handfish survey data (1997–2019) supported by previous NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub work [Project A10](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-a10-conservation-handfish-and-their-habitat.html) helped develop a time-series of survey data, increasing biological understanding and contributing to effective management actions. This project recommenced surveys of multiple local populations, after a two-year gap, to ensure that the potential impacts of development of the Derwent estuary and surrounds handfish populations or their habitats can be detected. Included in the population surveying was identification of suitable locations to plant Artificial Spawning Habitats (ASH) where natural spawning structures have declined. This will continue to support the species' captive breeding program with industry and foster engagement with the indigenous and broader community through participation, talks, outreach, publications, and the National Handfish Recovery Team (NHRT).",

  "description": "Coastal Australia is home to 37 regularly occurring migratory shorebird species, with many protected areas including Ramsar sites designated on the basis of shorebird populations. Many migratory shorebirds are declining rapidly, and hence the focus of conservation efforts at multiple levels of government in Australia and overseas. However, trend data are now nearly 10 years old, meaning the information available to assess where conservation actions are needed most urgently and whether conservation efforts are helping species recover are outdated.\n\nTo ensure populations have the best chance at recovery and that resources are allocated where they are most likely to have the greatest positive impacts, it is critical to maintain up-to-date information on species trends. This project analysed 30 years of shorebird monitoring data collected by citizen science groups across Australia and curated by BirdLife Australia’s National Shorebird Monitoring Program to update national trend estimates, while also assessing the relative effects of human pressure and conservation efforts on population trends. In particular, it focused on 15 migratory shorebird species whose conservation status was being reassessed by the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This project sets the stage for building the next decade of coastal shorebird conservation activity in Australia, coordinated through the national mechanism of the End User: National Migratory Shorebird Conservation Action Plan Steering Committee, with representatives from national and state governments as well as leading shorebird experts.",

  "description": "Kelp forests create complex habitats that support a diverse and productive community of marine life. They underpin coastal food-webs, fisheries, and a suite of other ecosystem services including nutrient and blue carbon cycling. Across much of the world, kelp forests are in decline and under threat from stressors including urbanisation, overgrazing, ocean warming, and marine heatwaves driven by climate change.\n\nAustralia’s giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) forests are listed as a Threatened Ecological Community under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Habitat restoration is a potential tool for the conservation and management of giant kelp ecosystems. Given the direct impacts of climate change and ocean warming, there is growing recognition of the need for habitat restoration to be ‘future proofed’.\n\nFor restoration to be effective, the cause of habitat decline must be understood and overcome. This is problematic when climate change is driving habitat loss since it cannot be reversed or ameliorated prior to restoration. A previous NESP project led by this team ([NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub Project E7](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-e7-%E2%80%93-assessing-feasibility-restoring-giant-kelp-beds-eastern-tasmania.html)) identified warm-tolerant strains of giant kelp from remnant patches in eastern Tasmania, where the species has experienced precipitous declines due to ocean-warming. These strains have high potential to assist with ‘future-proofing’ kelp forest restoration, however it is still unclear what the physiological mechanisms are that provide their improved thermal tolerance. It is also unknown whether cross-breeding the identified warm-tolerant giant kelp strains will affect and potentially improve their thermal tolerance capacity.\n\nThis project explored the physiology of kelp thermal performance, specifically the mechanisms potentially responsible for the warm water tolerance identified in particular giant kelp strains. It confirmed the improved ability of the warm-tolerant strains to develop at stressful warm temperatures relative to normal giant kelp, and demonstrated for the first time that their improved thermal performance may extend to the development and fertilisation. The outcomes progress toward the identification of populations of Australian kelp that may be resilient to (or especially threatened by) ocean warming and climate change.",

  "description": "The Challenge\nClimate change contributes to an increased frequency of extreme weather events in Australia, such as heatwaves, floods, bushfires, and droughts. As a result, the agricultural sector faces tougher and more unpredictable weather conditions. \n\nThis makes it more difficult for farmers to manage their farming practices and select the optimal crop breeds, since different breeds have varying resistance to drought and disease, with clear consequences for our food security and economy.\n\nVarious research organisations, government departments, industries and rural research and development corporations invest in trials to understand how factors such as weather, soil and pests affect crop growth and quality. However, since the data are generated from a range of sources, they often differ in their format, scale, frequency and precision. \n\nThis makes it challenging to compare the data, and to understand the true relationships between the crops and their environment. Understanding and modelling these relationships is crucial to inform agricultural management practices and maximise yield.\n\nThe Approach\nWe are supporting our partner, the Australian Plant Phenomics Network, to standardise access to Australia’s crop research data. The project is working with established research farms and agricultural/ecological research facilities across the nation to develop a framework, standards and recommendations for sharing agricultural data in a clear and consistent way. \n\nTest data from these research farms and facilities will be used to establish data management protocols. The protocols will be created according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data principles, which will allow the data to be easily used and compared. \n\nThe project will also develop user access tools that integrate time series information about crops and their environment. This will give researchers the ability to more easily compare data on crop growth, performance, weather and other dynamic influences over time. \n\nUsing this project as a ‘proof of concept,’ this model can be expanded to the whole agricultural sector or adopted by other sectors in future.\n\nBy standardising agricultural data and developing tools that integrate information about crops and their environment, researchers will be able to work towards developing optimised breeds of crops that can withstand Australia’s changing climate. It will also enable the sector to more reliably monitor, predict, and optimise their agricultural practices to safeguard our food security.",

  "description": "Consecrated life is a divine gift from God to the Church through the Holy Spirit, rooted deeply in the example and teachings of Christ (Pope Paul, 1996). Consecrated life communities, as described by Kanu (2019) and Noronha (2019), are unique societal structures where individuals, guided by the Holy Spirit, commit to poverty, chastity, and obedience, dedicating themselves to God and symbolising the life to come. This research aims to enhance understanding of leader-member relationships within these communities, thereby contributing to their overall well-being, and sustainability. The study aims to illuminate specific leadership approaches, leadership development, and subjective well-being and community environment within these unique settings. To achieve this, the study will employ a small-scale autoethnography, drawing on my personal experiences as a community member. Additionally, a combination of qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews and focus groups, will be applied to captivate diverse perspectives from leaders and members. The anticipated outcomes of this research include a comprehensive understanding of leader-member dynamics within consecrated life communities and practical insights to bridge generational and relational gaps. The findings could potentially inform leadership practices and contribute to the well-being of these communities, thereby having a significant societal impact.",

  "description": "When searching for love, some people are stuck in a continuous cycle of successfully initiating a relationship, not being able to maintain long-term engagements, and embarking upon a path to a destined break-up. Others are stuck in relationships they are not happy with. And, some have given-up on having relationships altogether. The concept of relationship sabotage can explain why and how this phenomenon occurs; however no empirical research existed in this area until recently. Research needs to continue to further validate the newly developed Relationship Sabotage Scale. Additionally, research in this area will benefit from exploring how individuals’ differences contribute to relationship difficulties in young people and adults. ",

Further analysis will be conducted using this cohort to investigate the significance of lifestyle behaviour changes during the Covid-19 phase in early 2020 and significance to post surgery outcomes associated with extended waitlist times to surgery. \nThe implications of this research will inform decision making for preparations and planning for future pandemics on the delivery of elective surgery services and patient healthy lifestyle information prior to surgery.",

  "description": "Background: Children and young people (0–16 years, 17–24 years) with intellectual disability have long been known to experience inequities in accessing healthcare1,2. They show a significant difference in health outcomes and life expectancy when compared with the general population. Sometimes this is associated with their diagnosis or disability but is more commonly a result of healthcare barriers and systems that do not meet their needs. In addition, for those who receive healthcare, many have negative experiences, including adverse patient safety events such as medication errors, wrong procedures or iatrogenic injury3,4. One of the key barriers cited in literature relates to be difficulties in identification of flagging of these children and young people in need of reasonable adjustments5. In response the Sydney Children’s Hospital’s network (SCHN) has developed an alert and flagging system – All About Me- that staff can use to record information about the child or young person in need of adjustments.  It is meant to inform clinical teams whether they need to make reasonable adjustments to improve the safety, quality and experience of hospital care for vulnerable children and young people.   Aim: To investigate the reach of the All About Me improvement initiative. Research questions: 1) what is the efficacy of the time  in enabling reasonable adjustments and 2) what is the impact on children and adolescents with intellectual and developmental disability ID/IDD experience and outcomes.",

  "description": "This study aims to gain insight into the dominant pedagogy, knowledge and word-level teaching practises of Australian early primary teachers (classroom, learning support and/or literacy coaches) working with students in their first four years of schooling from Foundation to Year 3 (F-3).  This research has a non-experimental mixed methods design that aims to collect two types of data: quantitative data via an anonymous survey (phase one), followed by semi-structured interviews from a random sample of Australian teachers (classroom, learning support, literacy coaches) working in Foundation (year before year 1) to year 3 classrooms (phase two & three). The research utilises both quantitative and qualitative methods. The methods are mixed as an anonymous online survey (using Qualtrics) was used to gather objective and measurable data. This data will be uploaded to and analysed using SPSS software. Interviews will be recorded on Teams and transcribed and analysed using Nvivo software.",

The participants were normotensive, had gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia and were assessed at six-months, two-years and five-years after birth for anthropometric, blood pressure, and psychological assessment. The babies were examined by a paediatrician and their mother, at each time-point, and a psychologist at two-years. The substudy investigates the participants’ experience throughout P4, through a questionnaire administered at the 5-year time-point that includes two open-ended questions and a closed-question allowing participants the opportunity to provide feedback on their clinical trial experience. The data collected will procure an understanding of the impacts of clinical trials on participants, aiding researchers in creating studies that are acceptable and welcomed by the general population.

  "description": "Australia has among the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world; two out of three people in Australia will have some form of skin cancer by age 70. Those living in regional and rural areas have a higher incidence of skin cancer than their metropolitan counterparts, and yet, the reach of skin cancer services to regional, rural, and remote Australia is limited to non-existent. General Practitioners (GPs) are primarily responsible for opportunistic skin cancer detection, often made difficult by constrains on consult times, further exacerbated by the maldistribution of primary care providers in rural areas. One solution may be to better utilise nurses as primary providers of skin checks in collaboration with these GPs. This study will examine the barriers and enablers of nurse-led skin checks in rural Australia. Semi-structured interviews will be used to assess the perceived barriers and enablers to a nurse-led screening model, from the perspective of the practitioners who deliver these services. If successful, this project will highlight how to improve future implementation of a nurse-led screening model, and better position future skin screening methods for uptake in rural communities.",

Ultrasound (US) has been used as a measure to detect IFM muscular atrophy in DPN patients. In addition, exercise is beneficial in delaying the usual course of DPN, skin damage and ulceration. However, diabetic patients have lower physical activity rates due to limitations such as difficult access to therapy, poor compliance, and limited support to maintain exercise therapy. Therefore, this study aims to assess whether a newly developed biofeedback device, 'Archercise' – a foot muscle exercise and strengthening tool, can correlate IFM Cross-Sectional Area (CSA) measured by US with foot arch control and performance.",

  "description": "Description textAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrythmia increasing the risk of stroke and limiting one’s ability to carry out day to day activities. Catheter ablation uses various forms of energy to ablate aberrant parts of the left atrium, thus restoring a normal rhythm. While this treatment is effective for patients with short-lasting AF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), the outcomes for patients with longer standing AF, persistent AF (PsAF) and long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF), are suboptimal. The Hybrid Catheter Ablation and Surgical Ablation (HyCASA) procedure was developed to treat patients with difficult-to-treat AF. It combines catheter ablation of the endocardium, performed by a cardiologist, with surgical ablation of the epicardium, performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon, in either a staged or concurrent approach. This procedure has the advantage of creating a durable lesion of the posterior left atrium while minimizing the risk of damage to local structures, such as the oesophagus. This procedure has been shown to be more effective than catheter ablation alone for PsAF and LsPAF, with acceptable safety.  \nOur primary aim is to investigate the efficacy of the HyCASA procedure in patients with AF who have previously failed at least one catheter ablation and anti-arrythmic drugs. Procedural efficacy will be demonstrated by the proportion of patients who fail the procedure over at least 12 months of follow up time. We will also demonstrate efficacy using AF burden over 12 months, where AF burden is the time spent in AF divided by the total monitoring time. \nThis is important research to conduct because it provides evidence as to whether the HyCASA procedure is a viable option for patients with AF who failed catheter ablation and anti-arrythmic drugs previously.",

  "description": "Iron deficiency is common in heart failure patients, and effective treatment improves symptoms and quality of life. Australian guidelines recommend iron testing and treatment, but the real-world implementation and impact are unclear. Utilising MBS and other data in the National Health Data Hub, linked to the National Echo Database of Australia, this required information can be obtained, delivering efficient, evidence-based healthcare measures while ensuring privacy. The data will benchmark iron testing against guidelines, evaluate the impact of timely intravenous iron therapy, assess outcomes like hospitalisations and mortality, and guide clinical decisions on choosing the correct MBS iron item and retesting frequency. It will empower patients to discuss results with clinicians and improve clinical support tools across disciplines. The initiative aims to drive practice change, enhance patient awareness, support ongoing research, and set a precedent for using linked MBS/PBS data.",

  "description": "This project aims to use data collected from paediatric cochlear implant recipients from Perth Children’s Hospital (PCH), to analyse the prevalence and types of medical comorbidities within this population. Studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with congenital deafness also have additional medical comorbidities, many of which are associated with poorer surgical and developmental outcomes. Importantly, patients with medical comorbidities are frequently excluded from cochlear implant studies, so published research investigating outcomes may not accurately reflect a large proportion of the patient population. PCH is the main tertiary implant clinic for paediatric patients in the state, and having more information about the prevalence of comorbidities within the implant patient population may influence future outcomes for these patients. This project would allow implant teams to contextualise the outcomes for patients more broadly by comparing those with and without medical comorbidities. The findings will be important for future service provision and planning and allow comparison of outcomes with the literature and other implant centres with a similar comorbid composition.",

  "description": "The role of transplant centres and healthcare workers in providing dedicated services to support the ongoing care of AYA recipients is therefore crucial in transition phases (Ullrich et al., 2004). Transplant centres provide follow-up care and monitoring and offer a range of support services, including counselling, education, and resources to help patients and their families navigate the transplant process and adjust to life post-transplant. However, there is minimal literature of transplant centre impact on the transition period for AYA solid-organ recipients and there is a lack of uniformity of programs and resources for pre- and post-transplant care of AYA’s in Australia and New Zealand.  To gain a better understanding of existing services, practices, protocols and support structures in transplant centres in Australia and New Zealand, we propose an exploratory survey of healthcare providers who provide transplantation services for solid organ transplant recipients in Australia and New Zealand. It is hoped that these results will identify areas of strength and gaps in services that can be targeted to improve the services and outcomes for AYA solid organ transplant recipients.",

Similar to other international and national jurisdictions, Western Australia (WA) is grappling with shortages in the midwifery workforce exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, strict border closures and midwives leaving profession. To promote the growth and sustainability of the midwifery workforce, the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Office has partnered with The University of Notre Dame to establish a pilot ‘Paid Employment Model’ for midwifery students. This model supports Registered Nurses to undertake a Diploma of Midwifery while retaining paid part-time employment within a WA HSP. It is envisaged that this model will attract and retain midwifery students who are then employed as professional midwives after graduation. WA Health has funded 60 students, 40 in WACHS and 20 in metropolitan settings, to undertake the pilot program along with six clinical facilitators to provide on-site support. This project aims to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, impact and economic benefit of the Paid Employment Model for midwifery students.",

  "description": "Despite advances in cancer treatments and increased survival of advanced melanoma patients, most patients with advanced melanoma will still die when treated with routine immunotherapies due to immune evasive mechanisms[1]. The personalised immunotherapy program will, instead, ensure each patient’s cancer is screened for genetic and immune profiles to identify patients unlikely to benefit from standard therapies. These patients will then be assigned a novel clinical trial agent most likely to cure them based on the presence of the drug targets in the patient's tumour. It is anticipated that selecting treatments for patients, based on the presence of specific drug targets in the patient’s cancer, will improve cancer outcomes and increase the survival of people with cancer. \n\nThis project aims to optimise the multiplex immunohistochemistry staining panel that can be used to rapidly identify the profile of immune checkpoint targets in melanoma biopsies. Further, the project aims to elucidate the accuracy of the artificial intelligence (AI) program to correctly identity fluorescent threshold for immune marker positivity. \n\nThis project will accurately and cost effectively fast track patient assessment for immunotherapy treatments; thereby rapidly matching patients with effective therapies to increase the overall cure rate of advanced cancers.",

  "description": "The highly variable clinical outcomes have made it difficult to identify the precise mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and thus the development of a specific cure or treatment to halt and reverse the inexorable decline in patient health. Chronic inflammation is a cardinal feature of IPF and is driven by both innate and adaptive immune responses. We recently demonstrated a potential role for antibody secreting plasma B cells (PCs) in the development of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Human studies also showed both elevated serum autoantibodies and elevated numbers of antibody secreting cells in IPF blood, and the accumulation of mature PCs adjacent to areas of active lung fibrosis in IPF lung tissue, supporting a functional role for PCs in IPF pathogenesis. We have used a multi-omics approach to examine the B cell repertoire of a subset of IPF patients and age-matched controls as well as screening IPF patient sera against a proteomic array to identify potential human autoantigens. We have shown that the B cell repertoire in IPF differs to that of control patients, with IPF patients displaying a restricted antibody repertoire compared to controls and evidence of B cell clonal expansion. We have identified a range of novel autoantigens in a subset of IPF patients. These findings suggest an approach for stratifying IPF patients based on an autoimmune phenotype that may inform treatment options for some of these patients. The UNFOLD study investigates the potential of immunotherapy for this chronic lung disease and specifically will 1) Validate specific common autoantigens using larger, geographically disparate IPF patient cohorts. 2) develop more appropriate and sensitive screening assays for early diagnosis and stratification to identify autoimmune IPF patients and 3). Test the suitability of novel plasma cell-specific B cell ablation and CAR-T cell therapy approaches in pre-clinical models of lung fibrosis.",

Since 2022, the researchers have worked with MercyCare to provide professional learning to educators on spirituality for young children. A SCF was developed that built on the researchers’ prior work along with the work undertaken with MercyCare. The SCF aims to provide a resource for professionals working with young children seeking to intentionally promote young children’s spirituality as part of their holistic development. This is the first Framework of its kind and as such, understanding the way educators make use of the Framework, and how they come to understand and promote children’s spirituality from its adoption, will be innovative, providing new knowledge in this field. The findings will be impactful for MercyCare specifically, but for the early years sector more broadly as they seek to invest in programs and approaches that assist educators in delivering quality early learning experiences.",

  "description": "Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks' gestation, poses significant risks to neonatal health and can lead to long-term consequences. Cervical shortening is a common precursor to preterm birth, and prevents the mechanical reinforcement of the cervix, in maintaining the pregnancy. Topical vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage are medical interventions aimed at prolonging gestation and reducing preterm birth rates. While cerclage is more effective in extreme cases of shortening (<10mm), combining progesterone with cerclage shows promise in moderately shortened cervixes (25-10mm). This prospective pilot study seeks to assess the efficacy of this combined approach in increasing gestational age and minimising neonatal complications.",

  "description": "This Honours project in History will investigate publicly available archival records held at the WA State Records Office about the 1983-1984 Western Australia Aboriginal Land Inquiry. In 1983, the Burke government commissioned the inquiry in an attempt to fulfill their election promise on land rights, appointing Justice Paul Seaman to find the best form of land rights for Western Australia. The inquiry emerged at a time of growing unrest and land rights activism among Aboriginal people, particularly in WA with the steady encroach of mining in the north-west, and creation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976/77, that was passed by the Liberal Federal Government. Several hundred submissions were received from many sectors of WA society and more broadly.  These included Aboriginal organisations, the resource industry, pastoralists and graziers, community groups, academics, and lawyers. \nTo date, limited to no historical research has been conducted on this project. This project seeks to place this Aboriginal Land Inquiry in its full historical context, including the fact that land – who owns it, and who has access to it – is at the core of settler-colonialism. This inquiry was the first time Indigenous communities had been asked about their vision for the future. This project seeks to recover their forgotten voices.",

  "description": "There is a growing global demand to approach maternal healthcare in a more woman-centred, culturally sensitive, and humanised way (16). A national survey from Australia indicates that around half of all women giving birth experience some level of birth trauma within the maternity system, and that 85% of women would make different choices for their next birth (17). A humanised approach to maternal health care not only addresses the physical needs of mothers but also prioritises their mental, emotional, and social well-being. The evidence demonstrates that such approaches lead to better health outcomes, higher satisfaction, and reduced disparities, making it a beneficial model for maternal health care (18,19, 20, 21). Acupuncture supports humanised holistic care by providing personalised, integrative, and culturally sensitive treatments that address the mind-body connection, and thus, can play a supportive role in maternity care (22). Acupuncture’s ability to reduce stress, improve mental health (23,24, 25) and manage pain (26, 27) aligns well with the principles of holistic and humanised care and highlights acupuncture's role in enhancing patient-centred, comprehensive health care (28). \nAcupuncture services are not new to BC Women's Hospital, as acupuncture has been offered at the ‘Families In Recovery’ (FIR) Unit for 2.5 years, and is the most requested and utilised allied health service on the unit. Verbal feedback from the FIR unit's patients suggest that acupuncture significantly improved conditions such as mental health, sleep quality, stress levels, and other concerns. However, no formal evaluation of the service offered at FIR has occurred. Because of the noted success in the FIR unit, a pilot\nprogram to expand to the antenatal unit (Evergreen) and the Reproductive Mental Health outpatient unit was created. This study, which evaluates this service, will be conducted at BC Women's antenatal unit, Evergreen, to examine what conditions acupuncture is most commonly requested for, and to examine its benefits or harms. The findings will help determine whether acupuncture positively supports clinical practice and if the services should be continued or expanded.",

This research project is focused on the aged care residents of the three Mission Australia aged care facilities, of which service a unique population. The people Mission Australia supports experience significant disadvantages such as physical or mental health concerns, and do not have a safe place to call home. As such, the age range in these sites is much younger, from 50-90 years old, and the gender breakdown is more male dominated, with 75% males and 25% females. Therefore, standardized aged care leisure and lifestyle applications may not be as relevant to these sites and this survey, which the government requires to be undertaken, will allow tailored consumer-centred care. The aim of our project is to analyse and compare the offerings leisure and lifestyle of rural and metropolitan Mission Australia Aged Care facilities and to facilitate more meaningful activities. The study objective is to ensure the leisure and lifestyle services provided to consumers at Mission Australia Aged Care sites are appropriate and relatable to them, as well as find aspects that need improvement.",

Paediatric burn patients have an increased long-term risk of a variety of serious health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infectious disease, mental health conditions and cancer (1-6). Chronic inflammation and sustained changes to the immune system after a burn may be related to the increase in morbidities seen in this population regardless of burn size and scar outcome (7, 8).\nPsychologically, poor mental health outcomes are more likely in a child who has been hospitalised for a burn injury compared to a peer who has not had a burn, and this remains true regardless of burn size, severity, and scar outcome. Psychosocial screening of patients and parents postburn might help us to understand baseline indicators of poor longer-term mental health recovery.\nPhysically, adults who have had a burn injury participate less in leisure-related physical activity (9), and have lower physical fitness (10). Paediatric burn patients might also have lower physical activity levels and impaired fitness resulting from physical and physiological limitations imposed by the burn, psychological limitations of the patient, overprotectiveness of the parent, or due to comorbidities secondary to burn.",

This study seeks to further examine existing data from the scale evaluation which was conducted by the University of Canberra in collaboration with Diabetes Australia. This study will examine the same dataset to evaluate differences in the care needs of women living with GDM across different levels of geographical remoteness. This project seeks to develop a greater understanding of the holistic healthcare needs of women with GDM, including the impact of geographical remoteness and locality size, in order to improve GDM models of care across Australia. Comparative descriptive analysis of the dataset will use a non-parametric statistical test to compare the results of women based on their recorded postcode and corresponding class of remoteness according to the Modified Monash Model (MMM) for remoteness.",

In addition, the wait times to see an ED physician or General Practitioner are increasing and this leads to extra pressure placed on emergency nurses, along with frustrated patients, which may lead to increased violence and aggression in the ED. \nBurn-out is becoming a worrying concern amongst ED nurses. The occupational stressors such as excessive workload, violence and aggression, and staff shortages are placing increased pressure on nurses, which is affecting nurses’ well-being and attrition. The increasing number of ED nurses leaving their job, and the nursing profession is concerning, therefore it is important to understand the stressors and employ strategies to protect these nurses from burn-out, which will may lead to improved retention and improved patient outcomes.",

  "description": "Short, conscious gynaecological procedures are performed regularly at Women and Newborn Health Services (WNHS) as an essential component of caring for women.  This service contributes significantly to “A life course approach to health” as defined by the National Women’s Health Strategy 2020-2030 (2019), by way of preventative health, diagnosis, treatment and management of gynaecological conditions.  Anecdotal evidence from staff at King Edwards Memorial Hospital (KEMH) caring for patients undergoing these procedures, suggests there is a variation amongst patients’ experience of this service. \nAim\nThis project aims to understand clinician’s perspectives and describe their experience regarding the provision of care for patients undergoing short, conscious gynaecological procedures to optimise care provision and identify areas for improvement. \nMethodology\nUtilising a lens of quality improvement as defined by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC et al., 2023), this project will adopt a qualitative descriptive design to capture the perspectives of health professionals. \nSignificance\nUnderstanding the perspective of fellow clinicians on what their colleagues feel is done well and areas for improvement will provide evidence to assist in improving this model of service delivery.",

  "description": "Burns are one of the most common forms of traumatic injuries globally, and are\nattributed to longer stays in hospital, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU), compared to\nother injuries. Burn pathophysiology is complex, consisting of multiple phases of disordered\nmetabolism that contribute to the challenge of burn treatment and management.\nWhile there are studies in the published literature that provide evidence for the benefits\nof early excision and grafting of burn wounds, there is still no consensus for the optimal timing\nto burn surgery for adult patients, in terms of what is early and how to translate earlier surgery\ninto practise.\nUsing data collected in the Western Australian Burn Clinical Data Registry since 2004,\nthis retrospective cohort study aims to explore this gap in the literature. From a sample\npopulation consisting of patients that underwent surgery for their burn injuries, patients will be\ncategorised into cohorts (<48 hours, 48 hours to 5 days, and >5 days) derived from the time\nbetween burn diagnosis and burn surgery. The associations between time to surgery and\nvariables including length of hospital stay (LOS), duration of care, hospital-acquired\ncomplications (HACs) and in-hospital intervention will be statistically analysed for\nsignificance.\nThe results of this study aim to better inform surgical management of burns in an acute\nsetting. By potentially providing evidence for improved outcomes, these results will clarify the\noptimal timing of burn surgery for better short-term post-operative outcomes.",

The aim of this study will be fourfold. First, to explore the beliefs, perspectives and practices of early childhood (EC) teachers who identify as being play-based in their approach to teaching and learning and consider how these beliefs are reflected in the environment, early childhood curriculum, teaching pedagogies and learning experiences employed in PP-Yr1. Second, to investigate the beliefs and practices of children towards play and play-based teaching and learning. Third, to explore the beliefs and perspectives of parents towards play and play-based teaching and learning. Finally, the research will aim to provide an in-depth account of the actual affordances and hindrances to play and implementing a play-based approach during these critical EC years in WA.",

The study will explore how participants perceive gender inequality within their communities and how these views are shaped by Christian beliefs, by collecting primary qualitative data through interviewing participants from five major church denominations in the Solomon Islands. It will also include interviews with key informants such as church leaders, NGO representatives, and program implementers to understand their roles in addressing gender inequality and their views on the effectiveness of faith-based initiatives in shifting harmful gender norms.",

Co-researchers will include people who are (or have been) involved in the on-Country immersions, including judicial representatives, on-Country hosts, facilitators and interpreters. An Aboriginal Reference Group will oversee the cultural aspects of the research. Methods include one-on-one interviews, courtroom observations, and analysis of court documents. The co-researchers in the PAR will use the findings to inform the design, delivery and evaluation of future programs; develop a 'Theory of change for two-way learning'; and create a framework to inform future evaluations of on-Country programs. The project ultimately aims to build towards a more culturally-safe court environment for Aboriginal people in Western Australia’s criminal justice system.",

  "description": "The aim of the study is to improve interprofessional collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacists (CPs) by exploring GPs’ communication preferences from pharmacists, which will support the development of efficient and timely communication pathways. This will lead to safer and more coordinated care for patients with asthma and COD, especially in relation to medications and supporting treatment adherence according to the previous studies. The objectives are (1) to explore GP’s preferences and expectations regarding communication from pharmacists in terms of asthma and COPD management, (2) to assess challenges and barriers that GPs encounter secondary to the current lack of a systematic communication strategy around GPs and pharmacists, (3) to identify enablers that support interprofessional collaboration from the insights of GPs, and (4) to identify recommendations for GPs-pharmacists communication strategies aligned with the existing GPs’ electronic medical record (eMR)and clinical workflows.",

In this study there is a trend analysing the increase of participation rates in sporting clubs after the Olympics every four years from 2015 to  2024. The data is categorised yearly participation rates from Swimming Western Australia (WA), Athletics West. As well as the impact the Olympics has on Independent schools participation in swimming and athletics. These results indicate that there is a four-year cycle impacting sporting clubs’ for both swimming and athletics participation. Likewise there is a  correlation impacting positively on Independent schools. This study also serves as a guide to make recommendations that schools consider adapting programs with the potential to see greater participation co-synced with the four year Olympics cycle.",

  "description": "The Maugean skate (*Zearaja maugeana() is listed as Endangered under Tasmania’s *Threatened Species Protection Act and the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999*. Its known population is small (~3,000 individuals, Macquarie Harbour, 2016) and highly restricted, having only been recorded in two isolated estuaries: Bathurst Harbour and Macquarie Harbour in south-western/western Tasmania. This constitutes one of the most limited distributions of any known extant elasmobranch.\n\nAlthough the skate was first discovered in Bathurst Harbour, most knowledge of the species stems from the Macquarie Harbour population. Only four individuals have been reported in Bathurst Harbour, with the last reported sighting in 1992. Environmental conditions in Macquarie Harbour have changed markedly since then due to anthropogenic activities in and around the estuary including historical mining, hydro-electric generation and alteration of natural river flows, and marine fish farming.\n\nPrevious research has shown clear signs of population stress and evidence of detrimental impacts of degraded environmental conditions on the Maugean Skate in Macquarie Harbour. Understanding the potential population status of the Maugean Skate in Bathurst Harbour will assist in determining conservation actions. This study used Environmental (e) DNA to determine the presence/absence of the endangered Maugean skate (Zearaja maugeana) in Bathurst Harbour, strengthening the evidence base for effective conservation plans and specific recovery actions.",
