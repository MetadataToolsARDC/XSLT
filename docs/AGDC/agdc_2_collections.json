This was a contracted survey conducted for the Australian Hydrographic Office by Fugro Australia Marine as part of the Hydroscheme Industry Partnership Program. The survey area encompases an area North of Gulf St Vincent, South Australia. Bathymetry data was acquired using a Kongsberg EM2040 and processed using CARIS HIPS & SIPS processing software. The dataset was then exported as a 30m resolution, 32 bit floating point GeoTIFF grid of the survey area. This dataset is not to be used for navigational purposes.",
