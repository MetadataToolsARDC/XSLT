The data base is a listing of all deaths that have occurred in Australia since 1980 . It is an invaluable tool for epidemiologists and clinicians in following up research cohorts using record linkage.\nEstablishment of an Australian National Death Index was first proposed by the National Health and Medical Research Council in October 1979. The proposal was endorsed by the National Committee for Health and Vital Statistics in July 1982, and by the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference in April 1984. The Public Health Advisory Committee recommended, in August 1984, that the National Death Index should be co-located with the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House at the then Australian Institute of Health. Consultation with the States and Territories followed and, by late 1992, all States and Territories had agreed to participate in the National Death Index.\nThe successful development and implementation of the National Death Index is due to the effective cooperation between the Institute, the State and Territory Registrars, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",

            "dp_description": "This is a research data collection. The Bureau of Meteorology currently have significant datasets that are of value to the wider environmental sciences community. These datasets are currently housed on infrastructure that is only accessible to the CSIRO and Bureau environmental sciences. The data has extended life and value as an asset to the wider science community and key Commonwealth agencies partners, such as Geosciences Australia. These data sets are spatio-temporal time series analysis of water level and other hydro-geological variables for a range of past and future scenario conditions. The datasets covered in this proposal are: 1. Murray Darling Basin Plan Draft Report Rainfall and Runoff data. These are the datasets produced by the MDSY Project to underpin the information in the Murray Darling Basin Plan reports. 2. The Australian Water Resources Assessment system Landscape model (AWRA-L) is a grid distributed biophysical model that simulates water stores and flows in the vegetation, soil and local catchment groundwater systems. The model aims to produce interpretable water balance component estimates, and as much as possible agree with water balance observations, including point gauging data and satellite observations. The model is intended to be parsimonious rather than comprehensive, to supports its use at moderate (1-10 km) resolution and in environments with few on-ground observations to constrain it. However in some instances a compromise needed to be found between a desire for parsimony and the requirement to simulate particular water balance terms. Data expected to become available over time are : a. Australia Water Resources Assessment (AWRA) model outputs - These provide daily continental datasets of streamflow, soil moisture, evapotranspiration b. Dataset of evapotranspiration estimates using the CSIRO MODIS Reflectance-based Scaling (CMRS) method c. AWRA calibration and benchmarking datasets This is data collated and reviewed for the purposes of calibrating and benchmarking the AWRA model. It comprises gauged streamflow, soils moisture measurements, evapo-transpiration measurements. 3. Bioregional assessment data - In response to community concerns about the potential risks from coal seam gas (CSG) and large coal mining developments, the Australian Government has agreed to strengthen regulation by ensuring decisions are informed by substantially improved science and independent expert advice. In order to better understand how these potential risks may impact our water resources, scientific investigations - called Bioregional Assessments - are being undertaken in selected regions. Bioregional assessments are world-first, science based studies that will develop detailed, multi-layered records of the natural environment in a particular geographic region.",

The forecasts charts show expected sea surface temperature, surface currents, sea level anomaly, and surface layer salinity for the next 7 days. Forecasts are updated daily. Published on public website charts represent surface layer only for the Australian domain and other areas around our coastline and offshore islands. For specialised users 3D ocean fields are delivered for the Australian domains (only Defence and CSIRO receive global forecasts). For registered users and Defence gridded products are disseminated using different channels (Bureau's registered user ftp servers and cloud systems).",

The Australian Water Outlook (AWO) is the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's hydrological service that gives users access to comprehensive, Australia-wide, nationally consistent hydroclimate data at multiple timescales - historical water balance information, seasonal forecasts, and hydrological projections out to the end of the century. The AWO Service interactive website is available at https://awo.bom.gov.au/ The Seasonal data collection: The seasonal data collection contains an updated archive of seasonal forecasts (1- to 3-months ahead) of soil moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff nationally. The Australian Water Resources Assessment system Landscape model (AWRA-L) seasonal forecasts are produced by forcing the Bureau's hydrological model AWRA-L with calibrated (downscaled) hindcast data from the The Australian Community Climate Earth System Simulator - seasonal 2 (ACCESS-S2) climate forecasting system. The data may be used in forecast evaluation, research and development of downstream application of forecasts which use seasonal AWRA-L forecasts as inputs. For more information about the AWO seasonal forecasts, including links to relevant technical reports and journal articles, please see the About Forecasts page (https://awo.bom.gov.au/about/overview/forecasts) on the AWO website.",

The survey area encompasses Banks Strait located between the Northern Tasmanian coast and the Furneaux Group (including Cape Barren, Clarke and Flinders Islands). Bathymetry data was acquired using a Kongsberg EM2040-04 MKII and EM 2040P multibeam sonar and processed using QPS Qimera V2.0.1.
