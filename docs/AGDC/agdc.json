Outside of field campaigns, six-minute volumetic scans were performed to compliment the local operational radar coverage (Mt Stapylton; 40 km to the east-southeast), providing dual Doppler coverage across much of the South East Queensland region.\n\nThis subcollection is separated into a number of products that relate to the level of processing applied.",

The hindcast set consists of an 11 member ensemble from the 1st, 9th, 17th, and 25th of every month for the period 1990-2012. ACCESS-S1 is based on the UK Met Office GloSea5-GC2 seasonal prediction system, but has enhancements to the ensemble generation strategy to make it appropriate for multi-week forecasting. The global coupled model includes high resolution atmospheric (N216 which is ~60 km in the mid-latitudes; and 85 levels in the vertical) and ocean (0.25 degree with 75 levels) models, as well as multi-layer land and sea-ice models.",

As a result of the implementation of the NDA, from 2009-10 the CSTDA NMDS was renamed the DS NMDS.\n\nFrom 1 July 2013, state and territory-based disability support services provided under the NDA were progressively transitioned over to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).

      "dp_description": "This is a research data collection. The Bureau of Meteorology currently have significant datasets that are of value to the wider environmental sciences community. These datasets are currently housed on infrastructure that is only accessible to the CSIRO and Bureau environmental sciences. The data has extended life and value as an asset to the wider science community and key Commonwealth agencies partners, such as Geosciences Australia. These data sets are spatio-temporal time series analysis of water level and other hydro-geological variables for a range of past and future scenario conditions. The datasets covered in this proposal are: 1. Murray Darling Basin Plan Draft Report Rainfall and Runoff data. These are the datasets produced by the MDSY Project to underpin the information in the Murray Darling Basin Plan reports. 2. The Australian Water Resources Assessment system Landscape model (AWRA-L) is a grid distributed biophysical model that simulates water stores and flows in the vegetation, soil and local catchment groundwater systems. The model aims to produce interpretable water balance component estimates, and as much as possible agree with water balance observations, including point gauging data and satellite observations. The model is intended to be parsimonious rather than comprehensive, to supports its use at moderate (1-10 km) resolution and in environments with few on-ground observations to constrain it. However in some instances a compromise needed to be found between a desire for parsimony and the requirement to simulate particular water balance terms. Data expected to become available over time are : a. Australia Water Resources Assessment (AWRA) model outputs - These provide daily continental datasets of streamflow, soil moisture, evapotranspiration b. Dataset of evapotranspiration estimates using the CSIRO MODIS Reflectance-based Scaling (CMRS) method c. AWRA calibration and benchmarking datasets This is data collated and reviewed for the purposes of calibrating and benchmarking the AWRA model. It comprises gauged streamflow, soils moisture measurements, evapo-transpiration measurements. 3. Bioregional assessment data - In response to community concerns about the potential risks from coal seam gas (CSG) and large coal mining developments, the Australian Government has agreed to strengthen regulation by ensuring decisions are informed by substantially improved science and independent expert advice. In order to better understand how these potential risks may impact our water resources, scientific investigations - called Bioregional Assessments - are being undertaken in selected regions. Bioregional assessments are world-first, science based studies that will develop detailed, multi-layered records of the natural environment in a particular geographic region.",

The Australian Water Outlook (AWO) is the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's hydrological service that gives users access to comprehensive, Australia-wide, nationally consistent hydroclimate data at multiple timescales - historical water balance information, seasonal forecasts, and hydrological projections out to the end of the century. The AWO Service interactive website is available at https://awo.bom.gov.au/ The Seasonal data collection: The seasonal data collection contains an updated archive of seasonal forecasts (1- to 3-months ahead) of soil moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff nationally. The Australian Water Resources Assessment system Landscape model (AWRA-L) seasonal forecasts are produced by forcing the Bureau's hydrological model AWRA-L with calibrated (downscaled) hindcast data from the The Australian Community Climate Earth System Simulator - seasonal 2 (ACCESS-S2) climate forecasting system. The data may be used in forecast evaluation, research and development of downstream application of forecasts which use seasonal AWRA-L forecasts as inputs. For more information about the AWO seasonal forecasts, including links to relevant technical reports and journal articles, please see the About Forecasts page (https://awo.bom.gov.au/about/overview/forecasts) on the AWO website.",

The 2025 NDSHS will mark the 15th in the series and the 10th managed by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) with funding from the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care. The survey aims to gather data from at least 20,000 Australian people aged 14 and over. It will collect data on: \n• Demographic characteristics \n• Attitudes of Australians towards a range of drug-related issues including their perception of the health risk associated with drug use \n• Patterns of drug use, method of use, source of supply and patterns of injecting drug use \n• Experiences of drug-related verbal and/or physical abuse and activities undertaken while under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs \n• Attitudes towards drug-related policy, interventions and legislation \n• Health status and mental health. \nResults from the survey will inform policy, monitor trends and evaluate progress under the National Drug Strategy 2017–26.",

The survey area is east of the Western approaches to the Torres Strait. Bathymetry data was acquired using a Kongsberg EM2040 (Dual/Single Head and Dual swath), EM2040P and LADS HD+ and RIEGL VQ-820-G systems and processed using CARIS HIPS & SIPS 11.3.17, LADS HD+ GS, RiWorld processing software. The dataset was then exported as a 30m resolution, 32 bit floating point GeoTIFF grid of the survey area. This dataset is not to be used for navigational purposes.",

It also assesses the program's support for families experiencing domestic violence and whether the current number and locations of CCSs meet existing demand. This data includes an analysis of quantitative data from a national survey of service providers, service management personnel, supervision staff and legal and non-legal professionals referring families to CCSs, and a Survey of Parents and Carers, including the collection of data in relation to their children's views and experiences of CCSs.",

The survey area encompasses a region located north of King Island in Bass Strait, including the approaches to Phoques Bay, located at the NW extremity of King Island. Bathymetry data was acquired using a Kongsberg EM2040D and processed using QPS Qimera V2.0.1. The dataset was then exported to GeoTIFF using CARIS HIPS and SIPS software. This dataset contains a 30m-resolution 32-bit floating point GeoTIFF file of the bathymetry in the survey area. This dataset is not to be used for navigational purposes.",

The DPA classification system is also used to distribute Australian-trained Bonded doctors who have a return of service obligation.The Distribution Priority Area (DPA) replaced the Districts of Workforce Shortage (DWS) system for GPs in 2019. DWS remains in use for non-GP specialists.DPA considers the demographics of a region, including age, gender and socio-economic groupings, along with MBS activity data, to determine a benchmark figure that reflects community need for GP service. DPA is calculated for 827 distinct, non-overlapping GP catchments throughout Australia. Catchments assessed below the benchmark are classified DPA.Areas classified MM 2-7 under the Modified Monash Model (MMM) geographical remoteness classification system are automatically DPA. Inner metropolitan locations are automatically non-DPA.The attached file for the DPA as at November 2023 (most recent annual update).

The period was chosen to cover a range of weather events, including the tropical cyclone, a front system over the SE and a large storm over the NW. Outputs include 2d variables at 10 minute resolution and 3d variables at 1 hour resolution, covering the full domain. Also included are the 2.2km grid spacing simulation used as an intermediate between Bureau of Meteorology atmospheric high-resolution regional reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) data and the target resolution, and a small ensemble of 2.2km grid spacing simulations covering the same period for statistical analysis.",

For key differences between the SAAP NDC and SHSC, see Appendix D of Specialist Homelessness Services 2011–12 (AIHW website). \n\nThe SAAP NDC provided nationally consistent information on SAAP clients and services from July 1996 to June 2011. It was jointly funded by Commonwealth, state and territory governments and comprised three main collections: \n•\tClient collection – the main component, captured socio-demographic information about clients receiving support under SAAP, services required by and provided to each client, and client circumstances before and after receiving support. \n•\tDemand for accommodation collection – which operated over a 1-week period, twice yearly. It captured information about the number of people who requested accommodation at SAAP agencies, which requests were met, and reasons for this.\n•\tAdministrative collection – collated from information obtained by state and territory government departments in the course of administering the SAAP program. It captured descriptive information about SAAP agencies.\n\nThe following special issues collections were also undertaken as part of the SAAP NDC:\n•\tCasual client collection – discontinued from the SAAP NDC in June 2005 when the definitions of client and support period were changed so that many people previously counted as casual clients would be counted in the Client collection from 1 July 2005. \n•\tAccompanying child in SAAP collection – collected information about the children who accompanied an adult and received assistance under SAAP between 21 May and 30 June 1998.\n•\tIncome issues collection – collected information on SAAP clients with no/very low income. It was conducted from May to June 2000.\nA number of methodological changes to the SAAP NDC occurred over time. Refinements to data items introduced in July each year are summarised in the annual reports for the data collection, available from the AIHW website. In particular, in 2005–06 a Core Data Set was introduced (collecting fewer data items, introducing a new statistical linkage key and incorporating changes to some definitions) and from 2000–01, the Client Collection captured demographic and support information for each child requiring assistance.\n\nThe AIHW continues to hold data collected through the following surveys of SAAP agencies conducted by the AIHW outside of the SAAP NDC:\n• High and complex needs census (June 2008).\n• Youth homelessness pilot programme collection (1 July 1997 to 31 December 1999).\n• NSW access and exiting project collection (23 August to 1 September 2002).\nAccess to SAAP data collected outside of the SAAP NDC is restricted.",

Each model of care is classified into 1 of 11 model categories based on these characteristics. This data set reflects maternity care at a service level but can also be used by maternity services to populate person-level models of care items in the National Perinatal Data Collection. Summary information about the models of care available at each maternity service can be found at the MaCCS website https://maccs.aihw.gov.au/",

It can be used for the design and evaluation of vessels, systems, equipment and clothing. This data can be used to conduct multivariate anthropometric analyses and to determine precise levels of fit and accommodation based on the anthropometry.

Data up to the previous calendar year are published in the annual report ‘Mesothelioma in Australia’ each year.  \n\nSince 2011, the AMR has collected information on new cases of mesothelioma diagnosed in Australia from 1 July 2010. The eight state and territory cancer registries provide incidence and mortality data on new cases of mesothelioma to the AMR. These records include demographic information and details of diagnosis and death. \n\nThe AMR also collects asbestos exposure information, obtained from consenting mesothelioma patients through a postal questionnaire and telephone interview. The postal questionnaire collects information on a patient’s residential history, occupational history and family history of mesothelioma. The telephone interviews collect additional information, based on responses to the postal questionnaire, to assess the likelihood of asbestos exposure.",

It brings together information on people receiving aged care and the services and organisations providing care. It largely contains administrative by-product data from the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing.\n\nThe NACDC comprises more than 130 tables in relational databases. Most of these relate to government-funded aged care programs operating under the Aged Care Act 1997.\n\nThe NACDC includes activity data for home support, home care, residential care, transition care, short-term restorative care and aged care eligibility assessments. It also includes other data sources related to quality indicators for residential aged care, consumer experience in residential aged care and aged care workforce.\n\nMost of the activity data is refreshed annually with data from the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing's Aged Care Data Warehouse. Data for quality indicators are supplied quarterly. Other data sources are updated on a less regular or ad hoc basis.",

The data base is a listing of all deaths that have occurred in Australia since 1980 . It is an invaluable tool for epidemiologists and clinicians in following up research cohorts using record linkage.\n\nEstablishment of an Australian National Death Index was first proposed by the National Health and Medical Research Council in October 1979. The proposal was endorsed by the National Committee for Health and Vital Statistics in July 1982, and by the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference in April 1984. The Public Health Advisory Committee recommended, in August 1984, that the National Death Index should be co-located with the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House at the then Australian Institute of Health. Consultation with the States and Territories followed and, by late 1992, all States and Territories had agreed to participate in the National Death Index.\n\nThe successful development and implementation of the National Death Index is due to the effective cooperation between the Institute, the State and Territory Registrars, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",

This data set presents an evaluation of the model, examining whether the model addressed practitioner and family safety during the program, safe parenting arrangements, the best interests of children, and power imbalances between parents. It also examines challenges and advantages due to the interdisciplinary nature of the model.",

It provides in-depth analyses of the aspirations, expectations and ideals of Australians as related to the question of whether to have children, or not. Particular attention is given to the ways in which views on having children vary according to age, gender, parenting status, relationship status, educational level, and employment status. Fieldwork began on 10 December 2003 and concluded on 22 March 2004. The final primary sample of 3,201 respondents comprised 1,250 men (39%) and 1,951 (61%) women. The population from which the sample was drawn was restricted to those aged between 20 and 39 years - the years in which women are most likely to have children. Surveying people aged 20-39 also allows us to gain an understanding of ways in which fertility expectations differ across the primary childbearing years. Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) was used to conduct interviews with respondents enlisted via random digit dialling (RDD).",

The National Hydrological Projection data collection consist of 16 ensemble members stemming from four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models and one regional climate model as well as three downscaled and bias-corrected models. Climate drivers from these models have been coupled with the Australian Water Resource Assessment Landscape model (AWRA-L) model to analyse changes on rainfall, runoff, soil moisture and evapotranspiration for two emission scenarios (RCP45 and RCP85). The AWRA model is a national, gridded water balance model co-developed by the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO which estimates soil moisture, actual and potential evapotranspiration, runoff and deep drainage on an ~ 5 km grid for all of Australia and at a daily scale. The AWRA-L model is calibrated to a wide range of climate conditions: one set of parameters can simulate hydrology over a huge range of climate, geological and vegetation conditions, while simultaneously providing soil moisture and evapotranspiration.",

The 2022 collection was originally planned for 2021 but delayed due to COVID-19. The scope includes various data items concerning prison entrants and prison dischargees over a two-week period, clinic attendances, medications administered and some general information about prisons and their operations.\n\nThe next collection is planned to occur in August 2025, with collections to repeat every 3 years thereafter (i.e., 2028, 2031 and so on). Data collected in 2025 is scheduled for release in 2026. Survey data is collected from people entering prison via an Entrants survey, and from people leaving prison via a Dischargees survey, conducted over 2-week periods across Australian prisons. The surveys collect data relating to health conditions, behaviours and health service use as people enter custody and leave custody. Demographic information relating to sex, gender, Indigenous status and age are also collected. In 2025, the NPHDC will collect unit record administrative data from jurisdictional prison and clinic systems for up to five files. The files contain data on client demographics, custody arrangements, health services, medications, and health conditions of people in Australian prisons. This builds on administrative data collected in the 2022 collection and is part of a longer-term development plan to transition the NPHDC to a fulsome administrative data collection that can supplement the survey data. An administrative data collection will help ensure the sustainability of the NPHDC by creating a more robust, higher quality data collection. The survey and administrative data will not be linked.",

The collection will be updated with new years of data as subsequent censuses are conducted. The Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) is a population-based measure of children’s development as they enter their first year of full-time school. The AEDC measures 96 items over 5 areas or ‘domains’ of early childhood development through a teacher-completed instrument: physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge. Aside from the domain variables, the AEDC also includes a range of background and demographic variables that provide contextual information on children’s development, including information relating to a child’s school, teachers, demographics, parents’ background, geography and community.",
