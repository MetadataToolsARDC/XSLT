As a result of the implementation of the NDA, from 2009-10 the CSTDA NMDS was renamed the DS NMDS.\nFrom 1 July 2013, state and territory-based disability support services provided under the NDA were progressively transitioned over to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). This has meant that 2018-19 was the last year for which DS NMDS was data collected and reported.",

            "dp_description": "This is a research data collection. The Bureau of Meteorology's Compact Polarimetry 2 (CP2) Research Radar operated at Redbank Plains (27°40.0'S, 152°51.5'E), Queensland from 2007-2015. This unique system collected simultaneous polarimetric observations at S-band and X-band, providing a unique dataset for quantifying precipitation properties.\n\nThe radar was used for two field campaigns, the Southeast Queensland Cloud Seeding Research Program (CSRP) from December 2007 - March 2008 and November 2008 - February 2009 , and the Coastal Convective Interactions Experiment (CCIE) from 2012 - 2014. Outside of field campaigns, six-minute volumetic scans were performed to compliment the local operational radar coverage (Mt Stapylton; 40 km to the east-southeast), providing dual Doppler coverage across much of the South East Queensland region.\n\nThis subcollection is separated into a number of products that relate to the level of processing applied.",

This surface was created from a contracted national reference survey in Cairns QLD, collected for the purpose of calibrating multibeam echosounders. It was conducted for the Australian Hydrographic Office as part of the Hydroscheme Industry Partnership Program, acquired using R2Sonic 2022, and processed using Caris HIPS & SIPS. Seperate grids in 0.5m resolution are provided for the three surveyed sites within this survey area in MSL, LAT and Ellipsoid vertical datum. The dataset was then exported as a 0.5m resolution, 32 bit floating point GeoTIFF grid of the survey area. This dataset is not to be used for navigational purposes.",
